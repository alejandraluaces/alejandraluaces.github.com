            <h3><a href="/cssprogressbars.html">CSS Progress Bars</a></h3>
            <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
            <p>Today, for me, was all about CSS positioning and fun progress bars. Probably sounds tedious and confusing to most, but this is my every day.</p><!-- more -->
<p>I am currently working on a project where I evaluate my skillset coming into the apprenticeship. I wanted to show this through progress bars that had a little bit of drop shadow detail, a little bit of text, and some cool blurred images in the background. I wanted to mimic a really cool layout style that I've seen before, and that my co-apprentice Adam Kaplan executed for his <a href="http://adamkaplandesign.com/position-properties.html" alt="Adam Kaplan Design: Position Properties">positioning project</a>.</p>
<p>I won't elaborate too much because I will have to complete this same project soon--but I had to use a bunch of new CSS that I'd never used before. It was fun to learn and looks great so far.  My goal is to have it complete by Thursday or so. It would be great to be done Wednesday, but.. we'll see.</p>
