            <h4>April 08, 2013</h4>
            <p>Some things never change, even over time. The resilience of cockroaches. The shape of bread (for the most part). The fact that razors still haven't adapted to the shin bone or knee. The fact that, somehow, everyone forgets to RSVP to everything.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like these other things that have stood the test of time, in this industry we will always have some beef between "designers" and "programmers". Even in more modern times where the phrase "web developer" has been coined and niche carved, there still exists some polarity and as such, animosity. So, what's the big deal?</p><!-- more -->

<h5>Myth: Being a Designer is Easy/Designers are Dumb</h5>
<p>This is not only degrading but, more importantly, very untrue. You know that quote by Einstein that has been completely overused (the one probably not even said by Einstein anyway)? "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Well, here, that holds a lot of truth. Confession time: I have never been great at math. Really, I hate it. Whenever I see numbers, I freeze up. It's not because I'm a woman, or because I'm dumb--it's just because I don't think that way. And, in a similar vein, logic and equations and parentheses freak me out. This is why I would not make a great programmer. </p>
<p>But consider what I <em>am</em> capable of and what I <em>am</em> good at doing--I am good at helping programmers develop something that a client will be pleased to see. I am good at thinking like a consumer and making things less frustrating for consumers to use. I can't tell you how many times I've heard programmers say something along the lines of, "I know it looks bad, but I can't tell you why." Well, <em>I</em> can tell you why, and I can work with you to find a great solution that won't break anything.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate my intellegence.  Instead, appreciate how I can help you deliver something that will be well-received by someone who doesn't understand all the back-end stuff you spent weeks doing, so that all your hard work doesn't go to waste.</p>

<h5>But, your books are smaller..</h5>
<p>Sorry about that. It's because they're filled with concepts and ideas rather than formulae and syntax. They require a great deal of creativity and imagination to fully comprehend, and require lots of thought and further processing long after we're done reading.</p>

<h5>Cooperation and Communication Are Key</h5>
<p>Though we think differently, that doesn't mean we have to work differently or segregate ourselves within the same project.  Cooperation is key: communication, flexibility and adaptability are, and always have been, valuable. With a programmin', designin' duo, cooperation is certianly not impossible. Pairing is great between designers and developers because changes can be made on-the-fly and things explained that otherwise would take days to get across.</p>

<h5>The Crossover Model</h5>
<p>"Designers" sometimes get a bad rap from their less-skilled, lazier peers: the kind of designers that live in Photoshop, hardly know how to code (and don't care to learn), give incomplete information (not providing a style guide), choose form over function, and take forever to produce anything (waterfall vs agile).</p>
<p>Though "there's always one", the number of professionals that are <em>not</em> like that is steadily growing. Now you have "web developers," the crossover vehicles/jack-of-all-trades of the web world. These people typically place a high value on both logical and spatial thinking, are up to date on web standards and practices, who are communicative and more open with sharing their knowledge, who work the agile way, who realize the imporance of brand continuity on various platforms/media, and are more quality individuals in general because they tend to place an emphasis on continuing education and personal growth.</p> 
<p>Having people like this around is great since programmers won't need to be bugged to make simple changes: a web developer will be able to navigate something like a <code>hiccup</code> document where there's both hiccup and clojure and will be able to tweak not only design elements, but will also be able to tackle bits of code.  These individuals are true Renaissance (wo)Men.</p>

<h5>You're leaving ______ out..</h5>
<p>Of course, describing two different kinds of people is not entirely possible since there are all "kinds" of people.  The point is that "designers vs. developers" doesn't have to be one of those great historical face-offs. Thinking differently allows problems to surface that otherwise wouldn't have, and working together is a much more efficient way to get things done.</p>
