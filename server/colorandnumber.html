            <h3><a href="/colorandnumber.html">Lightning Talk: Using Colors & Numbers in Design</a></h3>
            <h4>July 12, 2013</h4>
            <p>Today, I will be giving a lightning talk about colors and numbers.  I discussed numbers in design briefly in my post about <a href="http://alejandraluaces.com/decodingdesign.html">Decoding Design: Understanding and Using Symbols in Visual Communication</a>. </p>

<p>The other apprentices will be giving talks as well. I am super excited since, as today is Friday, there will be several people coming to listen.  One of my passions is teaching people about the things I really love and believe in--of course, one of them being design principles and how to engage people in your product, service, etc.  So, it'll be fun teaching a group of programmers the basics about colors and numbers! Angelique and Susan (two other 8th Light employees who have been in town this week) are here too, so I am excited to show them my presentation as well.</p>
<p>If you're interested in viewing the slides, you can scroll through them here. It's a bit different because the slides aren't accompanied by my bad jokes and explanations! But it'll serve until I have time to make a modified slideshow with notes. :) </p>
