            <h3><a href="/balance.html">Balance</a></h3>
            <h4>March 01, 2013</h4>
            <p>It has become increasingly hard trying to find a balance in my life between different projects and my personal life, though I realize it is something I must do. Learning discipline has been a priority for me in general, and now it's essential that I show I am capable of this balance.</p><!-- more -->
<p>Switching between client work and my apprenticeship projects is probably the hardest thing for me. It's great to be able to work on two drastically different things, but I find it hard to flip the switch in my brain between the two. This week I worked almost exclusively on client work, neglecting my apprenticeship projects.  Next week I will probably work a lot on apprenticeship projects just to catch up.</p>
<p>That being said, I am having fun and learning a lot. Jekyll is a templating language for Clojure that I have been learning. Lots of brackets and parentheses.  But I am finding that it comes easier with practice (and mistakes).
