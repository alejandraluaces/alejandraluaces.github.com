            <p><em>Decoding Design: Understanding and Using Symbols in Visual Communication</em> turned out to be a really great book. At first, I delayed reading it because the artwork inside seemed outdated, almost textbook-like in nature. Contrary to my first thought, the book is not outdated but covers principles that are firmly rooted in art, mathematics & science and thus, are timeless.</p>

<p>This book has really inspired me to look closer into the reasons why things as subtle and seemingly irrelevant as numbers trigger such an emotional reaction.  I am highlighting the meanings behind, and the imporance of, the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5 (which, coincidentally, are the first numbers of the Fibonacci sequence).  These are the numbers that I think are the most important in design, especially when grouping elements.</p>
<p><strong>One:</strong> The number one represents an individual item, but also the "whole"; everythingness. It represents our beginning (whatever you choose to believe is the beginning, whether it is the first amoebic life on this earth, a specific creator, being, or diety, the beginning of the universe, etc). It is important to remember that "in order to perceive "one", a field of nothingness is necessary." Therefore, ONE single item that you'd like to stand out needs to be displayed amongst things that have a similar contrast to the background, fonts that are a lighter weight, or just stark nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>Two:</strong> Two is a very symbolic number. It is the origin of lots of religious symbols in particular.  The yin-yang is based on two--showing opposites that are interdependent. Two is best used when trying to demonstrate high tension in design, or strong partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Three:</strong> Three is probably the most important number in design because it's roots are biological in nature--three is a very pleasing number to group elements in because it signifies completion.  Everything has a beginning, middle, and an end. The color we see is based on three--light wavelengths are based on three components and the ways they reflect or blend. In math, three is the first number to represent a plane or surface (one is just a point, two is a line). It also signifies balance - </p>
<p><strong>Five:</strong> Five is the number of the human element.  It is relateable, foundational, and represents quintessence or the "fifth element". To be used in navigation most effectively.</p>
