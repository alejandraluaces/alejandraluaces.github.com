            <h4>May 31, 2013</h4>
            <p>Obviously, this week has been a bit of a whirlwind. I haven't had any time to post, really, since we had a three day weekend this past weekend and I really had to hit the ground running to get my stories done for IPM on Wednesday and for today, Friday.</p>

<p>The school registration page is coming along just fine. It's all about adding little by little to refine the design and add new features, so I figure it's pretty close to how real client work will be with 8th Light. I am starting to add some fancy CSS transitions and effects, and am really excited to start plugging some jQuery in.</p>
<img src="/blog/images/tictactoe.png"><p>I am also working on some other projects besides my partnership project. I'll be working on a tic tac toe interface with Chong, and working on a site with Adam for some security talks he will be doing. I also recently found out I'll be redesigning the SCNA website, which is both an honor and a terror! I have tons of ideas, though, so I know I'll make something totally bad ass.</p>
<p>Miami this weekend for a much needed break. ^^ I'll be going on a private feeding tour with a friend of mine from zookeeping school who works in the Zoo Miami aviary. Then, we'll go to an art show, where the animals' art will be displayed. Then, on Sunday, I'll be heading to Fairchild Botannical Gardens where they have a plant show and sale. Hoping to find some cool stuff for the backyard.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
