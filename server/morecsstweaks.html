            <h3><a href="/morecsstweaks.html">More CSS tweaks</a></h3>
            <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
            <p>Lots of tweaks still today.  Lots of what I am doing with my self-evaluation is just making sure things flow well and the colors and fonts look good together. Right now, I am not going to worry about responsiveness because I am just starting to learn about it.</p><!-- more -->
<p> I am also going to be working on an <em>actual</em> client project which is very exciting, but becoming a top priority so I won't be able to do as many projects a week as I had planned.</p>
<p>Today, I also signed up for a couple of Skillshare classes that I think will help my design skills out a little.  I am taking a class on hand-lettering, and one on using pattern, texture, and color in illustrations. I have really been getting into both lately, and am happy to be able to share the resources with the rest of the design team.</p>
