            <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
            <p><em>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</em> by Bob Martin is a book that you can judge by it's cover.</p>
<p>Out of this book, I was only instructed to read a few chapters since, as a designer, not all of them applied to the work that I do.</p><!-- more -->
<p>The book felt a little redundant to me after my reading of <em>Getting Real</em> from a week or so ago. They are, of course, two different books with completely different approaches to the same mindset. <em>Clean Code</em> gives code examples and details more the process of creating and maintaining a beautiful program, while <em>Getting Real</em> provides a general, easy-to-digest outline for agile development.</p>
<p><em>Clean Code</em> is a great book and I got a lot out of my reading that I can implement in my projects and future endeavors. Specifically, I enjoyed reading about naming, formatting, and organizing my code. Though conciseness and efficiency are two of my greatest intentions, this book teaches that using longer, more descriptive names is best.</p>
<p>The book's emphasis on clutter and avoiding duplication was also something I fouund particularly useful, especially since I am a minimalist in most things--posessions, home decor, etc.  Especially with HTML and CSS, this is terribly useful.  Using shorthand is one great way to reduce clutter.  Using already-declared HTML5 tags instead of making endless divs to accomplish the same thing is very helpful.  In your CSS, you'll want to be as descriptive as possible in naming your classes so that if someone else has to work in that same document, they will know which element is which.  Establishing a base class for several elements that share different styles also helps to keep the document concise, organized, and straightforward.</p>
<p>So, while it may not outwardly seem like a great book for designers and programmers both, the important thing is to pay attention to the general concepts which can be applied anywhere within the software-sphere.</p>
