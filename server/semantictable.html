<!-- more -->

<p>For this project, I worked on replicating something tabular from print or internet. I decided I'd do the NPR Show schedule, as I listen to the station religiously, and the schedule on their website is messed up. </p>
<p>Tables are really no big deal--they're all just about remembering the placement of other object around them. I used html5 tags in this project--<code>thead</code>, <code>tbody</code>, and <code>caption</code>. I also added some phone icons I downloaded from <a href="http://fontello.com">Fontello</a>, and positioned them relative to their starting positions within their compartments. Fortunately, their positions were all pretty similar, so it only took one tag to manipulate them.</p>
<p>I'd never worked with tables beyond a table-based layout (the greatest of faux pas!), but now I feel much more comfortable producing them to work with complicated tabular data.</p>
