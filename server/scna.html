<p><a href="http://adamkaplandesign.com">Adam Kaplan</a> (the other design apprentice) gave the SCNA website a little facelift.  The website was originally done by <a href="http://nickmeccia.tumblr.com">Nick Meccia</a>  did <a href="http://scna2012.softwarecraftsmanship.com">the website</a> from last year.  It was super great, but we were asked to update it and change it to reflect current web trends and new web standards/practices. So, we broke the site up into sections to put emphasis on both our own creative potential, on the speakers, and on the attendees!</p>

<p>The page is written in Hiccup, which is a templating language for Clojure.  Adam took over most of the structural components and transferred the existing information over, and put up the new speakers and information.  I did what I do best and created some fun icons/badges for the front page, and paired with Adam to organize the contents and get the forms up an running.  It was a great experience in teamwork and pair programming as well.</p>
