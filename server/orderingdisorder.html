            <h4>July 01, 2013</h4>
            <p><em>Ordering Disorder</em> by Khoi Vinh is similar to a lot of the other design books I've read during my apprenticeship. Most of its content relates to the grid structure and designing a website.  It also gives a list of steps that can be followed when executing a design.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>The emphasis is on research and sketching. Vinh maintains that most of a designer's time should be spent in the research and sketching/planning process as opposed to in the coding process.  For me personally, this is really sound advice--I tend to start hacking away at code, changing things here and there to reflect what I'm seeing in my mind's eye.  I have never really felt any need to step up my planning game until working for 8th Light.  Now, I see its importance.</p>
<p>Good design is measured by how well it responds to the original problem, not how pretty it is, or how the color flows, or how intuitive the UX may be (though, those things may be solutions to an overall problem). This is why so much time should be spent in thoughtful study & brainstorming how to create a solution to a company's problem.  This is also where restraints should be considered, including technical, business, and content/editorial restraints.</p>
<p>Vinh also indicates that sketching is super important; not just in the beginning of your project, but throughout, as an easy/cheap way to brainstorm and test solutions.  Making Illustrator mockups at this point just won't cut it--he says to stick to pencil and paper for your first iterations, and then switch to more detailed sketches and mockups later on in the process. </p>
<p>The rest of the book beyond the Process section is all about Execution.  Here, you are taken step-by-step through the design of the Designery.us project, which helps the reader understand the practical application of what was only just touched on in earlier chapters.</p>
<p>Though similar to a lot of other books I've utilized in my apprenticeship, this book deserves a slot in my toolbox.</p>
