            <h4>June 03, 2013</h4>
            <p>It's funny to look back on my projects and posts and see the feelings I was going through and the things I was struggling with. They all seem pretty trivial now. I went back and read about semantic HTML and making progress bars with CSS, and laughed aloud at how much better I have gotten, and not just with comptuer-related stuff.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>I used to just freeze and procrastinate on things when I didn't know how they worked; fearing I wouldn't be able to get them done, or get them done on time.. fearing I would mess it up or no one would like it. Now, I am much more eager to learn new things and am more open to, and capable of, absorbing this new information. When pairing with folks in my office, my fingers fly across the keys--sometimes, I know exactly which CSS trick to try to get things working again. I am so proud of myself when I can easily come up with a solution for a coworker. It makes me feel more a viable part of our team.</p>
