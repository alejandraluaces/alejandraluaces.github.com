            <h4>February 08, 2013</h4>
            <p>Next on my reading list was <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, by Donald Norman. The book was actually first published in the year I was born, but the ideas and principles in the book remain relevant.</p><!-- more --> 

<p>As we move through our world, we are met with thousands of choices--most, if not all of which we are unaware. In my morning routine alone, I am met with hundreds of decisions based on the appliances and hardware that I am using. Using a coffee machine, faucets, doors and windows..</p>

<img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5301/5638283158_21bbf92d00_z.jpg" class="leftwrap"><p>Obviously, detailing all the points of this book would be laborious.  Some of the points I found most interesting and helpful for our purposes were centered around making difficult things simple. In software design, we are tasked with putting hundreds of different functions into something that should look streamlined, friendly, while also being intuitive.  We expect people to know or understand how to do certain things, where to look next, how to get back to what they were doing before.. there are so many things to take into consideration when designing things that can essentially become such a huge part of someone's everyday life.</p>

<p>A great example of this would be Apple products. Where having one button for every single function on an Apple device would become distracting, clunky, and cluttered, Apple utilizes intuitive gestures like flicking, pinching, spreading, and using multiple fingers for certain commands. It uses one of Don Norman's ideas--using both knowledge from the world and knowledge in the head.</p>

<blockquote>I have argued that people learn better and feel more comfortable when the knowledge required for a task is available externally--either explicit in the world or readily derived through constraints. But knowledge in the world is useful only if there is a natural, easily interpreted relationship between that knowledge and the information it is intended to convey about possible actions and outcomes. - Donald Norman, <em>The Design Of Everyday Things.</em></blockquote> 

<p>Apple's gestures perfectly illustrate this point. The gestures are natural to use because they mimic things we do outside of computing--say, flipping a page in a book or rotating a piece of paper on a flat surface. Gestures that we know well and have done before, sometimes without even realizing it, but things that just seem to make sense when applied in this way.</p>
