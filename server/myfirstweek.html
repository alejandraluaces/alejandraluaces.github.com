            <h4>February 03, 2013</h4>
            <p>It was really a stroke of luck for me to find out about this opportunity, and I'm so thankful I did. I can already safely say that I have never liked a job more, or worked with people who are so smart, who I can relate to as much as I am. People who I can talk to about anything I care about, and they just <em>get it</em>.</p><!-- more -->
<p>My first week here has just been getting handed books, given projects, and learning about the team and the way the company works. It's true--you do learn a lot, and quickly. This week, I used Github and got super frustrated. My first project was diving head-first into things I am not comfortable with in the least. By the end of the week, I was told I'd be working on client work. Yeah, fast. I love it!</p>
<p>My task for the next two weeks was to <strong>create a blog</strong> to post my book reviews and my projects for reference and for others to see. I am told this blog will morph and change much during my apprenticeship, so I am starting with something very basic--just a one-column design with some watercolor elements that I will vectorize in Illustrator to make them transparent .pngs. I wanted something to show off my style but something that I'd be able to evolve over time.</p>
<p>The next book on my reading list is <strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong> by Donald Norman, so I will be posting a little entry about that soon.
