            <h3><a href="/halfwaypoint.html">Halfway Point</a></h3>
            <h4>April 20, 2013</h4>
            <p>It has almost been three months since I started at <a href="http://8thlight.com">8th Light</a>, so just about the halfway mark of my apprenticeship. What better way to commemorate this milestone than to get a visit from one of the design craftsman!? I was so happy to finally be meeting one of the people I talk to every morning during standup.</p><!-- more -->
<p>Nick Meccia is one of our awesome craftsman, and I think we fit the same mold---we love concentrating on how things look and how they make people feel. It was super fun to be able to sit next to Nick and have him explain some of his critiques to me! It's hard to communicate these things over e-mail so it was awesome to get hands-on instruction for the things I have been not-so-great at.</p>
<p>I look forward to going to Chicago to experience the office up there. I am certain it will mean lots of hours of learning and being immersed in the 8th Light culture, which I am too excited about! Plus, that will mean seeing a huge city, literally the biggest I have ever seen, bigger than my hometown of Miami! I am a little intimidated but know it'll be so worth it.</p>
