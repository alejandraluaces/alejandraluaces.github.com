<p>Recently, I was tasked with redesigning the United website for a small board of people within 8th Light. The parameters I was given were just to keep all of the links/information, or have a good reason for excluding/moving it. I was told to create an HTML page that had no functionality, and to just "go crazy" to demonstrate my style and what I think would be a good user experience. So, it was definitely fun.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>The United website is stale and confusing.  There are too many columns and tabs placed arbitratily throughout the page, which is also riddled with advertisements with their services.</p>
<p>The goal I'd set for myself in this redesign was to design the page as an ode to the earlier days of air travel, where it was fun, easy, and luxurious. My first thought was of the Pan Am advertisements in old magazines which either made use of large pictures or illustrations of exotic destinations or used imagery of beautiful, well-dressed people lounging on a plane.  I wanted to bring back the element of intrigue, comfort, and extravagance to the proposed website since air travel these days seems more a burden than a pleasure.</p>

<p>Since lots of the options on the original United website could be done without, I opted to simplify the layout quite a bit. I made the navigation simpler, include big images of travel destinations that would make the user feel excited or calm, and used more casual phrasing and simple questions. The goal here was for the advertising to be more loyalty- or trust-based as opposed to feeling forced or gimmicky.</p>

<p>All in all it was a really fun project to work on, and definitely presented its challenges.  I learned a lot, like how to create responsive tabs (which I'd never actually had to do before) and worked with some Javascript (the images parallax when scrolling.)</p>  
<p>Upon completion of the project, I had an IPM with a small review board that included some craftsmen at 8th Light. I think the IPM went really smoothly.  Everyone offered great critiques and input which was really helpful and I think I handled all of the information really well.</p>
<p>Here's to more awesomeness like this in the future!</p>
