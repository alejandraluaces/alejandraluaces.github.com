    <h4>July 01, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p><em>Ordering Disorder</em> by Khoi Vinh is similar to a lot of the other design books I've read during my apprenticeship. Most of its content relates to the grid structure and designing a website.  It also gives a list of steps that can be followed when executing a design.</p>

    <h4>June 23, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p><em>The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</em> is a book whose chapters are written as "tips", giving it a more casual, friendlier feel than many guides to a programming career.  It is meant to be an answer or even rebuttal to <em>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</em>, a book talking about becoming a programmer or advancing in your programming career "by coincidence". The author of the book is also a musician, creating some interesting parallels between that and programming.</p>

    <h4>June 17, 2013</h4>
	    <p><img src="/blog/images/chicago/nightcity.JPG"><p>Two weeks ago, myself and four coworkers traveled to visit our home office in Chicago. It was my first time experiencing flying after what I will affectionately refer to here as the "Baltimore Flying Fiasco of 2011". Of course, as most people do, I learned it was not that bad and really quite great.  After two and a half hours, we were in a completely different and uniquely beautiful place, so it was all well worth it.</p>

I went back and read about semantic HTML and making progress bars with CSS, and laughed aloud at how much better I have gotten, and not just with comptuer-related stuff.</p>

Perhaps I can start to get my list of tips and tricks together to make a little more beginner-friendly blog post. But that's later.</p></p>

I know when I first started, I was having trouble keeping up with housework, keeping up with my relationships, having "me" time, and balancing client work. Things are pretty much the same, but kind of different (wow, so much clarity!).</p></p>

When Nick was in town a couple of weeks ago, we had a brief discussion about the importance of hierarchy, and how I can establish good hierarchy early on--in the planning stages of my projects. I did take his words to heart, but I am not sure that I am "getting it" just yet.</p></p>

	    <p><p><em>The Clean Coder</em> is yet another book on my reading list by Bob Martin, similar to "Clean Code," which I read last week. However, I liked this one a lot better! I think it was a lot more relateable for a designer since there were no code samples, and all of what I read I could really relate to and take to heart. I am going to write bullet points outlining the things that really meant the most to me from this book. I am excited to take this new knowledge with me into the future of my career!</p></p>

    <h4>April 08, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p>Some things never change, even over time. The resilience of cockroaches. The shape of bread (for the most part). The fact that razors still haven't adapted to the shin bone or knee. The fact that, somehow, everyone forgets to RSVP to everything.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like these other things that have stood the test of time, in this industry we will always have some beef between "designers" and "programmers". Even in more modern times where the phrase "web developer" has been coined and niche carved, there still exists some polarity and as such, animosity. So, what's the big deal?</p></p>
