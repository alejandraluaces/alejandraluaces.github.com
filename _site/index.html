    <p>My second week totally flew by!</p>
<p>Most of it was spent getting my blog up and doing more reading. Like I mentioned before, I got the chance to begin work on a client project, which was a little intimidating but still very exciting.</p>
<p>A bunch of books came in the mail that were supposed to get here Monday or Tuesday, so I'll be doing that this weekend! So excited; I love designer books since they're usually short, have a ton of pictures, and are always so beautiful.</p>

      <h3>February 08, 2013</h3>

    <p>Next on my reading list was <strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong>, by Donald Norman. The book was actually first published in the year I was born, but the ideas and principles in the book remain relevant.</p> 

<p>As we move through our world, we are met with thousands of choices--most, if not all of which we are unaware. In my morning routine alone, I am met with hundreds of decisions based on the appliances and hardware that I am using. Using a coffee machine, faucets, doors and windows..</p>

<img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5301/5638283158_21bbf92d00_z.jpg" height="200px" width="auto" class="left"><p>Obviously, detailing all the points of this book would be laborious.  Some of the points I found most interesting and helpful for our purposes were centered around making difficult things simple. In software design, we are tasked with putting hundreds of different functions into something that should look streamlined, friendly, while also being intuitive.  We expect people to know or understand how to do certain things, where to look next, how to get back to what they were doing before.. there are so many things to take into consideration when designing things that can essentially become such a huge part of someone's everyday life.</p>

<p>A great example of this would be Apple products. Where having one button for every single function on an Apple device would become distracting, clunky, and cluttered, Apple utilizes intuitive gestures like flicking, pinching, spreading, and using multiple fingers for certain commands. It uses one of Don Norman's ideas--using both knowledge from the world and knowledge in the head.</p>

<blockquote>I have argued that people learn better and feel more comfortable when the knowledge required for a task is available externally--either explicit in the world or readily derived through constraints. But knowledge in the world is useful only if there is a natural, easily interpreted relationship between that knowledge and the information it is intended to convey about possible actions and outcomes. - Donald Norman, <em>The Design Of Everyday Things.</em></blockquote> 

<p>Apple's gestures perfectly illustrate this point. The gestures are natural to use because they mimic things we do outside of computing--say, flipping a page in a book or rotating a piece of paper on a flat surface. Gestures that we know well and have done before, sometimes without even realizing it, but things that just seem to make sense when applied in this way.</p>

      <h3>February 02, 2013</h3>

    <p>Typography holds a special place in my heart; its importance is undeniable, yet, it is often overlooked. Pinterest and Tumblr have popularized hand-lettering, helping people realize typography's role in computer- and print-based media.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking With Type</strong> by Ellen Lupton has been on my Amazon wish list for a while, so I was excited to learn that it'd be the first item on my reading list for my apprenticeship at 8th Light. I actually finished the book before my first day.</p>

<img src="http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/images/Thinking_with_Type_Letter_1.gif" class="img" width="500px" height="auto">

<p>This book is an excellent resource; akin to how we'd use a dictionary to refer to words just within our grasp, but the true meaning escapes us. Thinking With Type delves into the deeper elements of typography, even past the letters, down into the most minute details like serifs, bowls, ascender and descender. The way Ellen Lupton describes type in the most sensual ways is really what gets me.</p>

<blockquote>"A well-designed comma carries the essence of the typeface down to its delicious details. Helvetica's comma is a chunky square mounted to a jaunty curve, while Bodoni's is a voluptuous, thin-stemmed orb."  -  Ellen Lupton, <em>Thinking With Type</em></blockquote>

<p>The book also covers numerous other type-related topics from kerning to utilizing the golden mean in creating a modular scale. <strong>Thinking With Type</strong> is an incredibly useful resource, and even has <a href="www.thinkingwithtype.com">a website</a> briefly covering all of the topics.</p>

      <h3>February 01, 2013</h3>
    </header>
    <p>It was really a stroke of luck for me to find out about this opportunity, and I'm so thankful I did. I can already safely say that I have never liked a job more, or worked with people who are so smart, who I can relate to as much as I am. People who I can talk to about anything I care about, and they just <em>get it</em>.</p>
<p>My first week here has just been getting handed books, given projects, and learning about the team and the way the company works. It's true--you do learn a lot, and quickly. This week, I used Github and got super frustrated. My first project was diving head-first into things I am not comfortable with in the least. By the end of the week, I was told I'd be working on client work. Yeah, fast. I love it!</p>
<p>My task for the next two weeks was to <strong>create a blog</strong> to post my book reviews and my projects for reference and for others to see. I am told this blog will morph and change much during my apprenticeship, so I am starting with something very basic--just a one-column design with some watercolor elements that I will vectorize in Illustrator to make them transparent .pngs. I wanted something to show off my style but something that I'd be able to evolve over time.</p>
<p>The next book on my reading list is <strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong> by Donald Norman, so I will be posting a little entry about that soon.
