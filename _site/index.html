      <h4>April 23, 2013</h4>
    <p>Some say that excellent work comes from passion, and some say excellent work comes as a result of great skill. Whatever "house" you belong to, it is a given that good work comes from dedication and preserverence, confidence and determination. </p>
<p>During last week when Nick was in town, we had a discussion about his apprenticeship, specifically the week of his challenges. What he said to me was very profound: both scary, yet comforting. He told me his challenges week was one of the most stressful and trying weeks, that he'd tried his hardest, and was convinced that he was just not good enough. Yet, he was okay with that fact. He knew that his hardest was the best he could do, and with that fact, he was completely content and at peace. He did not stress, he did not fret.</p>
<p>We all want to be an expert in the one thing we put all of our time and effort into. At least, if you are the kind of person I am -- ambitious and curious and hungry to a fault. I think that part of my challenge here at 8th Light is to let go of fear: the fear that I am not good enough, the fear that I will make a fool of myself, the fear that I will fail. I have to bring myself to see that nothing I do here can be considered failure--I am going through a learning and growing process; a dirt road littered with pot holes, weeds, and old tin cans. But the road will lead me to a place where I <em>will</em> be capable of greatness. <strong>Only</strong> if I stop fearing.</p>
<p>Nick also talked to me about one of our company's founders, Micah, who was coincidentally also Nick's mentor when he was an apprentice. Nick told me that Micah expects excellence from everyone -- not perfection or intellegence or anything really mesurable -- but excellence, the marriage of qualities mentioned above: dedication, preserverence, confidence and determination.  Things that you may not be born with, but things that you make the conscious decision to have or not to have. This is what our "boss" values -- people who work hard to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>With this reminder, I am preparing myself to work harder than ever for the final three months of my apprenticeship. I hope to write thorough and insightful blog posts, produce projects that "wow" and are representative of my skill, eccentricity, and newfound skills. I strive to excel in professionalism and kindness, and cultivate fruitful partnerships with my coworkers in preparation for my final challenges. When they come, I strive to be ready!</p>

      <h4>April 20, 2013</h4>
    <p>It has almost been three months since I started at <a href="http://8thlight.com">8th Light</a>, so just about the halfway mark of my apprenticeship. What better way to commemorate this milestone than to get a visit from one of the design craftsman!? I was so happy to finally be meeting one of the people I talk to every morning during standup.</p>
<p>Nick Meccia is one of our awesome craftsman, and I think we fit the same mold---we love concentrating on how things look and how they make people feel. It was super fun to be able to sit next to Nick and have him explain some of his critiques to me! It's hard to communicate these things over e-mail so it was awesome to get hands-on instruction for the things I have been not-so-great at.</p>
<p>I look forward to going to Chicago to experience the office up there. I am certain it will mean lots of hours of learning and being immersed in the 8th Light culture, which I am too excited about! Plus, that will mean seeing a huge city, literally the biggest I have ever seen, bigger than my hometown of Miami! I am a little intimidated but know it'll be so worth it.</p>

      <h4>April 19, 2013</h4>
    <p>Usability testing is a method of seeing the way your project is used & interacted with "in the wild," as a way of understanding how to make it easier.  There are both quantitative ("is this release easier than last release?") and qualitative methods (more informal, not trying to prove anything specific) of doing such.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Using test participants other than yourselves or coworkers works because everyone encounters usability issues. These issues are easy to find (though not always obvious to the person creating the app, site, or program), and watching users will make you a smarter, more thoughtful designer. </p>

<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Simply, as soon as possible. Being able to implement helpful feedback in the early days of a project will help avoid costly, sometimes irrepairable problems down the road. It doesn't matter if you have a finished project. It doesn't matter if your app or site has polish.  What matters is that you can find users along the way to show you whether or not you're going in the right direction---and to keep heading in that direction.</p>
<p>If necessary, you can perform the "napkin test" on the fly, where you may draw any one feature of your site or app for another person's inspection. Ask questions like, "What do you think this is supposed to be?", and hopefully the response will be that it looks like a home page, or a checkout screen, or whatever it is you've portrayed.</p>
<p>With testing actual wireframes, you can ask more about process. Give the test participant the wireframe and pose the question, "How would you do x?", or "How do you find y?" Wireframes are ideal for testing the clarity of your navigation and how you've named things.</p>

<h2>Whom?</h2>
<p>Of course, it's obvious that you'll want to test a diverse audience, but there's more to it than that.</p>
<p>You will want individuals with domain knowledge (realtors if you have a real estate app, medical professionals if you have a drug search app or something similar), but you'll also want some participants with none. This offers you an equally valuable outside perspective. You will surely want to include people that reflect your target audience.</p>
<p>This book suggests testing three users for every round of testing. Three seems like a small number, but just three will be able to point out your major problems while keeping cost and hassle down. It's more important to have multiple rounds of testing throughout the creation of your app rather than tons of people and one round of testing.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>
<p>As a <strong>facilitator</strong>, you will not only be the liason between your company/product and the participant, but you will also act as a tour guide and therapist. Your goal is to externalize the participant's thought process, which is no small feat. During this time, you must remain neutral--resist the urge to provide the participant with clues as to how to use the product.</p>
<p>Your debriefing should not last long and should only cover the most important usability issues. Fixes should be made by the next round of testing, and should only be the smallest, simplest change needed to keep the issue from happening. The emphasis should be on <strong>tweaking</strong> the existing design, rather than a complete overhaul.</p>

<h2>Analytics Software vs. Usability Testing</h2>
<p>Software like Google Analytics is very valuable, there's no denying that--it shows you exactly where your users are spending their time on your website. However, nothing is as valuable as being able to see <strong>how the user is getting there</strong>.</p>

<h2>Usability testing in an agile environment</h2>
<p><em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> suggests just one morning out of the month dedicated to usability testing. For those of us who work with short iterations, we don't have to restrict ourselves to mornings, or to in-person usability testing. Though not preferrable and only to be done after doing in-person testing, remote testing can work well: you've a much more diverse population to choose from and the tests can be short, casual, and as informative as they would be in person.</p>

	  <h2 class="titles"><a href="/thecleancoder.html">The Clean Coder</a></h2>
      <h4>April 14, 2013</h4>
    <p><em>The Clean Coder</em> is yet another book on my reading list by Bob Martin, similar to "Clean Code," which I read last week. However, I liked this one a lot better! I think it was a lot more relateable for a designer since there were no code samples, and all of what I read I could really relate to and take to heart. I am going to write bullet points outlining the things that really meant the most to me from this book. I am excited to take this new knowledge with me into the future of my career!</p>

	<li><p><strong>Professionalism</strong> is of utmost importance and can be very broadly summarized in three points: responsibility/accountability, cultivation of skills and professional development, and creating something that you are proud of showing off to the world--from both the front- and the back-end.</li>
	<li><p>A true <strong>professional</strong> finds four things to be of particular importance: practice, collaboration, mentoring, and humility, in no specific order.</li>
	<li><p>A <strong>professional</strong> is not obligated to <strong>say yes</strong>. However, you must work as hard as possible to be able to say yes. <strong>Teamwork</strong> is imperative when trying to find a solution to a problem.</li>	
	<li><p><strong>Pairing</strong> is one of the best way to get rid of "writer's block".</li>
	<li><p>"<strong>The Zone</strong>" is something to avoid, and is usually nothing more than a manic state wherein there is increased quantity, but not quality.</li>
	<li><p>Selectively attend <strong>meetings</strong>. If the meeting is necessary for the job you are doing now, attend. You are responsible for your own time management. </li>
	<li><p><strong>Iteration Planning Meetings</strong> should be quick and concise; if any one point takes longer than a few minutes to discuss, plan another time to discuss it more in depth. <strong>Demos</strong> should be held 45 minutes before the end-of-day on the last day of iteration.</li>
	<li><p>You only have a certain amount of "<strong>focus mana</strong>" per day. Some days it's more, sometimes it's less. <strong> Focus mana</strong> is a decaying resource, and it's best to use all of it, every day. It is important to know when to <strong>disengage</strong>.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Estimation</strong> is the middle ground between making a commitment (client's view) and guessing (programmer's view). It is not a number--rather, it is a distribution.</li>
	<li><p>There are three parts to making a <strong>commitment</strong>: saying you'll do it, meaning it, and actually doing it. Professionals do not make <strong>commitments</strong> they are not <em>absolutely certain</em> they can keep.</li>
	<li><p><strong>The PERT model</strong> allows you to break down your estimation into three parts: "O" is the <em>optimistic</em> estimate--if everything goes perfectly; "N" is a <em>nominal</em> estimate--the estimate with the greatest chance of success; and "P" is your <em>pessimistic</em> estimate--or if everything goes wrong, the longest it could possibly take for you to finish your project.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Collaboration</strong> is important. Team ownership of code gives everyone more of a feeling of camraderie and a sense of responsibility for upkeep, maintenance and improvement.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Teams</strong> are hard to build and establish, and will require some time to "ferment". Well-established teams can then go on to tackle all sorts of projects together, working efficiently. Establishing a successful team should always come before tackling projects.</li>
	<li><p>Only by being directly exposed to real-world scenarios will someone be prepared to deal with them. The <strong>apprenticeship</strong> model doesn't only work with skilled tradesmen like plumbers and electricians. <strong>Apprenticeship</strong> can be more valuable than a university education and will provide you with more-than-adequate skills and experience to enter the workforce, without all of the debt.</li>
	<li><p>You should learn just as much <strong>mentoring</strong> as you do independently learning--through teaching others, one has more understanding of the subject matter and enriches someone else's life at the same time.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Craftsmanship = professionalism</strong>. It is pride, skill, and confidence. It is approaching obstacles or issues with a clear mind, without avoidance. It is accepting responsibility. It is estimating accurately, knowing when to apologize, say no, and say yes.</li>

	  <h2 class="titles"><a href="/designersvsdevelopers.html">Designers vs. Developers</a></h2>
      <h4>April 08, 2013</h4>
    <p>Some things never change, even over time. The resilience of cockroaches. The shape of bread (for the most part). The fact that razors still haven't adapted to the shin bone or knee. The fact that, somehow, everyone forgets to RSVP to everything.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like these other things that have stood the test of time, in this industry we will always have some beef between "designers" and "programmers". Even in more modern times where the phrase "web developer" has been coined and niche carved, there still exists some polarity and as such, animosity. So, what's the big deal?</p>

<h2>Myth: Being a Designer is Easy/Designers are Dumb</h2>
<p>This is not only degrading but, more importantly, very untrue. You know that quote by Einstein that has been completely overused (the one probably not even said by Einstein anyway)? "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Well, here, that holds a lot of truth. Confession time: I have never been great at math. Really, I hate it. Whenever I see numbers, I freeze up. It's not because I'm a woman, or because I'm dumb--it's just because I don't think that way. And, in a similar vein, logic and equations and parentheses freak me out. This is why I would not make a great programmer. </p>
<p>But consider what I <em>am</em> capable of and what I <em>am</em> good at doing--I am good at helping programmers develop something that a client will be pleased to see. I am good at thinking like a consumer and making things less frustrating for consumers to use. I can't tell you how many times I've heard programmers say something along the lines of, "I know it looks bad, but I can't tell you why." Well, <em>I</em> can tell you why, and I can work with you to find a great solution that won't break anything.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate my intellegence.  Instead, appreciate how I can help you deliver something that will be well-received by someone who doesn't understand all the back-end stuff you spent weeks doing, so that all your hard work doesn't go to waste.</p>

<h2>But, your books are smaller..</h2>
<p>Sorry about that. It's because they're filled with concepts and ideas rather than formulae and syntax. They require a great deal of creativity and imagination to fully comprehend, and require lots of thought and further processing long after we're done reading.</p>

<h2>Cooperation and Communication Are Key</h2>
<p>Though we think differently, that doesn't mean we have to work differently or segregate ourselves within the same project.  Cooperation is key: communication, flexibility and adaptability are, and always have been, valuable. With a programmin', designin' duo, cooperation is certianly not impossible. Pairing is great between designers and developers because changes can be made on-the-fly and things explained that otherwise would take days to get across.</p>

<h2>The Crossover Model</h2>
<p>"Designers" sometimes get a bad rap from their less-skilled, lazier peers: the kind of designers that live in Photoshop, hardly know how to code (and don't care to learn), give incomplete information (not providing a style guide), choose form over function, and take forever to produce anything (waterfall vs agile).</p>
<p>Though "there's always one", the number of professionals that are <em>not</em> like that is steadily growing. Now you have "web developers," the crossover vehicles/jack-of-all-trades of the web world. These people typically place a high value on both logical and spatial thinking, are up to date on web standards and practices, who are communicative and more open with sharing their knowledge, who work the agile way, who realize the imporance of brand continuity on various platforms/media, and are more quality individuals in general because they tend to place an emphasis on continuing education and personal growth.</p> 
<p>Having people like this around is great since programmers won't need to be bugged to make simple changes: a web developer will be able to navigate something like a <code>hiccup</code> document where there's both hiccup and clojure and will be able to tweak not only design elements, but will also be able to tackle bits of code.  These individuals are true Renaissance (wo)Men.</p>

<h2>You're leaving ______ out..</h2>
<p>Of course, describing two different kinds of people is not entirely possible since there are all "kinds" of people.  The point is that "designers vs. developers" doesn't have to be one of those great historical face-offs. Thinking differently allows problems to surface that otherwise wouldn't have, and working together is a much more efficient way to get things done.</p>

	  <h2 class="titles"><a href="/jekyll.html">Jekyll Woes</a></h2>
      <h4>April 05, 2013</h4>
    <p>For this apprenticeship, I was tasked with setting up my blog using Jekyll and Github Pages.  Though I barely managed and had lots of help, I have been able to both maintain it and make massive changes.  Like anything, with exposure and a "dive in head first" mentality, learning is somewhat easy. Google searches also help.</p>

<p>Lately, I have been issues with my blog. First, the posts weren't showing up in the right "sections". Next, the images stopped working. Then, the layout.html/styles.css files weren't working. What gives? First, know a couple things about the way my blog is set up.</p>

<p>The way my blog works is that I have two blogs within one. Confusing? Sure. But it works.</p>

<pre>
|--_config.yml
|--_includes
|--_layouts
|  |--default.html
|  |--post.html
|--blog
|  |--index.html
|  |--_posts
|  |  |--2012-04-06-hello-world.md
|--projects
|  |--index.html
|  |--_posts
|--index.html
</pre>
<p>Each section should have its own folder, wherein you'll have an index.html, a _posts folder, and perhaps some other folders (although not necessary): css, images, etc. You'll have two different html files in the layouts folder, and you'll direct to them from the yaml front matter included in all of the posts.</p>
<p>Yaml is touchy. I learned this the hard way. My posts were in their respective sections (the _posts folder of each "separate" blog) and I was updating everything just as I should. So, what was the problem?</p>
<p>Punctuation. Punctuation was all the problem. This is something I never would have been able to figure out myself, because I do not think like a programmer. I am not hard wired to question the punctuation in anything, where it's placed, or what it could mean. All I know is that gramatically, it makes sense, and so I'm using it.</p>
<p>At the top of every blog post you'll put in the "_posts" folder, you'll have some Yaml that will tell the post how it will be laid out, where it is going on the page, and what the title and date are.  These are all user-specified.  If there is any punctuation in these, it will mess up.  I had a post in my blog/_posts/ folder whose title contained a colon. That little colon completely derailed my blog.</p>
<h2>So, how did I find the error?</h2>
<p>My mentor Justin showed me how to run <code>jekyll --no-auto --server</code>, which specifically tells you where your errors may be, the file name/location, and line number. It'll also let you know which character is throwing a wrench into the delicate innerworkings of your site. Pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Erasing the _site directory is another thing that you might want to do as well if you're encountering problems like this. That'll ensure that you're working from a clean slate if you have any corrupt files, and will help to avoid having to make changes to a bunch of files.</p>

	  <h2 class="titles"><a href="/gettingreal.html">Getting Real</a></h2>
      <h4>March 26, 2013</h4>
    <p>Recently, I finished up reading <em>Getting Real</em> by <a href="http://37signals.com/"><em>37signals</em></a>. When I was first assigned this reading, I was told I'd have a lot to say about it.</p>
<p>But I don't. And here's why.</p>
<p>8th Light is the first software company I have ever worked for. Therefore, I am somewhat of a blank slate. Several of my peers have the experience of working in massive companies, companies with management problems, companies that are not run by the principles outlined in this book.</p>
<p>Luckily, because I am such a "blank slate", agile development seems natural to me. As a freelancer, I worked like this without knowing it had a name. It just seems like the easiest way to operate efficiently and get things done. Talk to the customer often, make changes based on evolving needs while sometimes saying "no," and delivering parts of the project once they are ready.</p>
<p><em>Getting Real</em> is a book about more than just software development. It is a book that is accessible, easy to read, and simple to understand. </p>
<p>This book illustrates shedding excess and working with small steps rather than large, seemingly unattainable goals. It touches on creativity, and how it seems to flourish the more restrictions there are in place.  It emphasizes that it's okay for things to change during development, and that this change should be welcome. These are things that not only apply to software, but everything.</p>

	  <h2 class="titles"><a href="/handcraftedcss.html">Handcrafted CSS</a></h2>
      <h4>March 15, 2013</h4>
    <p>8th Light is all about craftsmanship.  Doing something we are proud of doing & doing it with enthusiasm, passion, and skill. Dan Cederholm, author of <em>Handcrafted CSS</em>, is obviously a huge proponent of this same mindset, making this book an appropriate addition to my reading.  
<p><em>Handcrafted CSS</em> does something important: it allows us to style things the way we want, while giving us tools to assure that these things degrade gracefully when being viewed with a lesser browser. Responsiveness is something that I have been learning about slowly through this apprenticeship, and is definitely a consideration---not only making things that are supported on smaller devices, but also making things that will be supported on older browsers. While I like to think that I'd make something akin to a 404 error message for people with Internet Explorer ("Too bad, maybe you should upgrade to something relevant!"), for some clients, that is obviously not an option. In some occupations, it is common for users to still be booting up a Windows 98 computer and running Internet Explorer 6-8. While we may weep at this very idea, we must also accept it and adapt to it by coming up with new ways to display things the way we want.
<blockquote>"The critical distinction between a craftsman and an expert is what happens after a sufficient level of expertise has been achieved.  The expert will do everything she can to remain wedded to a single context, narrowing the scope of her learning, her practice, and her projects.  The craftsman has the courage and himility to set aside her expertise and pick up an unfamiliar technology or learn a new domain." </blockquote>

	  <h2 class="titles"><a href="/balance.html">Balance</a></h2>
      <h4>March 01, 2013</h4>
    <p>It has become increasingly hard trying to find a balance in my life between different projects and my personal life, though I realize it is something I must do. Learning discipline has been a priority for me in general, and now it's essential that I show I am capable of this balance.
<p>Switching between client work and my apprenticeship projects is probably the hardest thing for me. It's great to be able to work on two drastically different things, but I find it hard to flip the switch in my brain between the two. This week I worked almost exclusively on client work, neglecting my apprenticeship projects.  Next week I will probably work a lot on apprenticeship projects just to catch up.
<p>That being said, I am having fun and learning a lot. Jekyll is a templating language for Clojure that I have been learning. Lots of brackets and parentheses.  But I am finding that it comes easier with practice (and mistakes).

      <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
    <p>Lots of tweaks still today.  Lots of what I am doing with my self-evaluation is just making sure things flow well and the colors and fonts look good together. Right now, I am not going to worry about responsiveness because I am just starting to learn about it.</p>
<p> I am also going to be working on an <em>actual</em> client project which is very exciting, but becoming a top priority so I won't be able to do as many projects a week as I had planned.</p>
<p>Today, I also signed up for a couple of Skillshare classes that I think will help my design skills out a little.  I am taking a class on hand-lettering, and one on using pattern, texture, and color in illustrations. I have really been getting into both lately, and am happy to be able to share the resources with the rest of the design team.</p>

      <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
    <p>Today, for me, was all about CSS positioning and fun progress bars.  I am currently working on a project where I evaluate my skillset coming into the apprenticeship. I wanted to show this through progress bars that had a little bit of drop shadow detail, a little bit of text, and some cool blurred images in the background. I wanted to mimic a really cool layout style that I've seen before, and that my co-apprentice Adam Kaplan executed for his <a href="http://adamkaplandesign.com/position-properties.html" alt="Adam Kaplan Design: Position Properties">positioning project</a>.</p>
<p>I won't elaborate too much because I will have to complete this same project soon--but I had to use a bunch of new CSS that I'd never used before. It was fun to learn and looks great so far.  My goal is to have it complete by Thursday or so. It would be great to be done Wednesday, but.. we'll see.</p>

	  <h2 class="titles"><a href="/cleancode.html">CSS Progress Bars</a></h2>
      <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
    <p><em>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</em> by Bob Martin is a book that you can judge by it's cover.</p>
<p>Out of this book, I was only instructed to read a few chapters since, as a designer, not all of them applied to the work that I do.</p>
<p>The book felt a little redundant to me after my reading of <em>Getting Real</em> from a week or so ago. They are, of course, two different books with completely different approaches to the same mindset. <em>Clean Code</em> gives code examples and details more the process of creating and maintaining a beautiful program, while <em>Getting Real</em> provides a general, easy-to-digest outline for agile development.</p>
<p><em>Clean Code</em> is a great book and I got a lot out of my reading that I can implement in my projects and future endeavors. Specifically, I enjoyed reading about naming, formatting, and organizing my code. Though conciseness and efficiency are two of my greatest intentions, this book teaches that using longer, more descriptive names is best.</p>
<p>The book's emphasis on clutter and avoiding duplication was also something I fouund particularly useful, especially since I am a minimalist in most things--posessions, home decor, etc.  Especially with HTML and CSS, this is terribly useful.  Using shorthand is one great way to reduce clutter.  Using already-declared HTML5 tags instead of making endless divs to accomplish the same thing is very helpful.  In your CSS, you'll want to be as descriptive as possible in naming your classes so that if someone else has to work in that same document, they will know which element is which.  Establishing a base class for several elements that share different styles also helps to keep the document concise, organized, and straightforward.</p>
<p>So, while it may not outwardly seem like a great book for designers and programmers both, the important thing is to pay attention to the general concepts which can be applied anywhere within the software-sphere.</p>

<p>Most of it was spent getting my blog up and doing more reading. Like I mentioned before, I got the chance to begin work on a client project, which was a little intimidating but still very exciting.</p>
<p>A bunch of books came in the mail that were supposed to get here Monday or Tuesday, so I'll be doing that this weekend! So excited; I love designer books since they're usually short, have a ton of pictures, and are always so beautiful.</p>

      <h4>February 08, 2013</h4>
    <p>Next on my reading list was <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, by Donald Norman. The book was actually first published in the year I was born, but the ideas and principles in the book remain relevant.</p> 

<p>As we move through our world, we are met with thousands of choices--most, if not all of which we are unaware. In my morning routine alone, I am met with hundreds of decisions based on the appliances and hardware that I am using. Using a coffee machine, faucets, doors and windows..</p>

<img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5301/5638283158_21bbf92d00_z.jpg" class="leftwrap"><p>Obviously, detailing all the points of this book would be laborious.  Some of the points I found most interesting and helpful for our purposes were centered around making difficult things simple. In software design, we are tasked with putting hundreds of different functions into something that should look streamlined, friendly, while also being intuitive.  We expect people to know or understand how to do certain things, where to look next, how to get back to what they were doing before.. there are so many things to take into consideration when designing things that can essentially become such a huge part of someone's everyday life.</p>

<p>A great example of this would be Apple products. Where having one button for every single function on an Apple device would become distracting, clunky, and cluttered, Apple utilizes intuitive gestures like flicking, pinching, spreading, and using multiple fingers for certain commands. It uses one of Don Norman's ideas--using both knowledge from the world and knowledge in the head.</p>

<blockquote>I have argued that people learn better and feel more comfortable when the knowledge required for a task is available externally--either explicit in the world or readily derived through constraints. But knowledge in the world is useful only if there is a natural, easily interpreted relationship between that knowledge and the information it is intended to convey about possible actions and outcomes. - Donald Norman, <em>The Design Of Everyday Things.</em></blockquote> 

<p>Apple's gestures perfectly illustrate this point. The gestures are natural to use because they mimic things we do outside of computing--say, flipping a page in a book or rotating a piece of paper on a flat surface. Gestures that we know well and have done before, sometimes without even realizing it, but things that just seem to make sense when applied in this way.</p>

      <h4>February 03, 2013</h4>
    <p>It was really a stroke of luck for me to find out about this opportunity, and I'm so thankful I did. I can already safely say that I have never liked a job more, or worked with people who are so smart, who I can relate to as much as I am. People who I can talk to about anything I care about, and they just <em>get it</em>.</p>
<p>My first week here has just been getting handed books, given projects, and learning about the team and the way the company works. It's true--you do learn a lot, and quickly. This week, I used Github and got super frustrated. My first project was diving head-first into things I am not comfortable with in the least. By the end of the week, I was told I'd be working on client work. Yeah, fast. I love it!</p>
<p>My task for the next two weeks was to <strong>create a blog</strong> to post my book reviews and my projects for reference and for others to see. I am told this blog will morph and change much during my apprenticeship, so I am starting with something very basic--just a one-column design with some watercolor elements that I will vectorize in Illustrator to make them transparent .pngs. I wanted something to show off my style but something that I'd be able to evolve over time.</p>
<p>The next book on my reading list is <strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong> by Donald Norman, so I will be posting a little entry about that soon.

      <h4>February 02, 2013</h4>
    <p>Typography holds a special place in my heart; its importance is undeniable, yet, it is often overlooked. Pinterest and Tumblr have popularized hand-lettering, helping people realize typography's role in computer- and print-based media.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking With Type</strong> by Ellen Lupton has been on my Amazon wish list for a while, so I was excited to learn that it'd be the first item on my reading list for my apprenticeship at 8th Light. I actually finished the book before my first day.</p>

<img src="http://portfolio.bgraphicstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thinking-with-type1.jpg" class="rightwrap">

<p>This book is an excellent resource; akin to how we'd use a dictionary to refer to words just within our grasp, but the true meaning escapes us. Thinking With Type delves into the deeper elements of typography, even past the letters, down into the most minute details like serifs, bowls, ascender and descender. The way Ellen Lupton describes type in the most sensual ways is really what gets me.</p>

<blockquote>"A well-designed comma carries the essence of the typeface down to its delicious details. Helvetica's comma is a chunky square mounted to a jaunty curve, while Bodoni's is a voluptuous, thin-stemmed orb."  -  Ellen Lupton, <em>Thinking With Type</em></blockquote>

<p>The book also covers numerous other type-related topics from kerning to utilizing the golden mean in creating a modular scale. <strong>Thinking With Type</strong> is an incredibly useful resource, and even has <a href="www.thinkingwithtype.com">a website</a> briefly covering all of the topics.</p>
