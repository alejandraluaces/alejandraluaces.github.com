    <h3><a href="/brandidentity.html">What is Brand Identity?</a></h3>
    	<h4>August 19, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>This is a question I get all the time. As a freelance brand designer, I often turned down work requests where the client asked for "just a logo". Brand identity itself is often confused with just the design of a logo, when the logo is really the smallest part of a much larger idea.</p><img src="blog/images/brandidentity.png" style="float:right; margin: 1em;">
<p><strong>The logo</strong> is the chief visual component of your brand identity, so it's pretty important. It  must be <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/26/vital-tips-for-effective-logo-design/?utm_source=CMblog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=Designing+a+Brand+Identity">simple, memorable, timeless, versatile, and appropriate</a>. Many small business owners focus on this aspect of their branding without worrying about the bigger picture: they pay a designer they found on a freelancing website (whose reputation they know nothing about) a hundred bucks to hack something together within a week so they can throw it on business cards, letterheads and coffee cups. Often, there is no thought given to the return on their investment for something that seems so arbitrary to someone who doesn't know any better. If branding isn't important, why do companies pay tens of thousands of dollars for it? A logo is where trust and loyalty are cultivated.</p>
<p><strong>Identity</strong> is where we start to get a little more into tangible things. Your materials will be laid out in a style guide or identity system wherein your company's identity will start to take shape; the fonts, colors, variations of your logo should be included.</p>
<p><strong>The brand</strong> is how consumers or users see your company, product, or service, and the emotional response associated with such. Seth Godin's definition is pretty spot-on:
	<blockquote>
		A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another. 
	</blockquote>
<p>Design ≠ Brand. Design helps to establish the brand, but the brand is mostly the culmination of that first impression (design) along with how your company represents itself, and the customer's individual or shared experiences with your product or service.</p>
<p>Say, for instance, you are the owner of a big-box retail store. A customer has a bad experience in your store which was handled poorly by the manager on duty.  As a result, this customer never comes back.  Obviously, the last thing on this person's mind was your branding, but rather, on your <em>brand</em> which involves their emotions, impressions, and personal experiences.</p>
<p><em>So, what is the bottom line? What exactly is brand identity? What am I going to get out of a brand identity specialist?</em></p>
<p><strong>Brand identity</strong> is the front-facing image of your company. It involves all things visual; brochures, business cards, stationery, <strong>logos</strong>. It is the icon on your phone, the favicon in a browser tab, the flooring of your retail location, the couch for your waiting room.  Your brand identity is how many letters you fit on a page, what pictures you include with your marketing collateral, and how many columns your website will have.  It is what first starts to form the way a customer feels about you before they experience what you have to offer. From there, the <strong>brand</strong> is developed by the company: providing a reputable product or service, reliable and pleasant customer service, effective and empathetic marketing, and a unique, personalized experience. It is the rude customer service agent on the telephone, the controversial social/political issues your company takes a stance on, the tag on your merchendise that gave my sister's husband's cousin a paper cut.</p>

    <h3><a href="/chicago2.html">Chicago, Part II</a></h3>
    	<h4>August 02, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Last week, my coworker Will and I traveled to Chicago. I so relish these opportunities to go to the big city. It gets me out of my element and comfort zone (plane phobias!), allows me to experience something new and different (food!), and immerses me in the cooperative culture of the office.</p>
<img src="blog/images/chicago2.jpg">
<p>My apprenticeship was extended for another two months and my mentor changed to Stephanie, so I went up to get acquainted with her and to be in their office environment a little more.  Adam had his challenges and it was really emotional for all of us--we all got a little teary eyed during Friday's standup. I am so proud of him and eager to get to that point in my apprenticeship as well.</p>
<p>I was able to pair with Stephanie during my trip.  Pair programming has gotten a lot of criticism, claiming that there are "high costs and negative value," but I find it to be an enriching, productive, and engaging experience. It keeps teams tight and encourages the feeling of group ownership of projects and code. During my pairing experience last week, I contributed to solving some big problems and learned a little bit of Objective-C along the way. Both of these things could not have been accomplished without this experience.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/united.html">United Airlines Redesign</a></h3>
    	<h4>July 17, 2013</h4>
		    <p><img src="blog/images/united1.png">
<p>Recently, I was tasked with redesigning the United website for a small board of people within 8th Light. The parameters I was given were just to keep all of the links/information, or have a good reason for excluding/moving it. I was told to create an HTML page that had no functionality, and to just "go crazy" to demonstrate my style and what I think would be a good user experience. So, it was definitely fun.</p>
<p>The United website is stale and confusing.  There are too many columns and tabs placed arbitratily throughout the page, which is also riddled with advertisements with their services.</p>
<p>The goal I'd set for myself in this redesign was to design the page as an ode to the earlier days of air travel, where it was fun, easy, and luxurious. My first thought was of the Pan Am advertisements in old magazines which either made use of large pictures or illustrations of exotic destinations or used imagery of beautiful, well-dressed people lounging on a plane.  I wanted to bring back the element of intrigue, comfort, and extravagance to the proposed website since air travel these days seems more a burden than a pleasure.</p>
<img src="blog/images/panam.png">
<p>Since lots of the options on the original United website could be done without, I opted to simplify the layout quite a bit. I made the navigation simpler, include big images of travel destinations that would make the user feel excited or calm, and used more casual phrasing and simple questions. The goal here was for the advertising to be more loyalty- or trust-based as opposed to feeling forced or gimmicky.</p>
<img src="blog/images/united2.png"><br><br>
<img src="blog/images/united3.png"><br><br>
<img src="blog/images/united4.png"><br><br>
<p>All in all it was a really fun project to work on, and definitely presented its challenges.  I learned a lot, like how to create responsive tabs (which I'd never actually had to do before) and worked with some Javascript (the images parallax when scrolling.)</p>  
<p>Upon completion of the project, I had an IPM with a small review board that included some craftsmen at 8th Light. I think the IPM went really smoothly.  Everyone offered great critiques and input which was really helpful and I think I handled all of the information really well.</p>
<p>Here's to more awesomeness like this in the future! Coincidentally, I received <a href="http://www.f-i.com/fi/airlines/">an article</a> in my inbox the next day about the future of the airline website.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/decodingdesign.html">Decoding Design</a></h3>
    	<h4>July 02, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>Decoding Design: Understanding and Using Symbols in Visual Communication</em> turned out to be a really great book. At first, I delayed reading it because the artwork inside seemed outdated, almost textbook-like in nature. Contrary to my first thought, the book is not outdated but covers principles that are firmly rooted in art, mathematics & science and thus, are timeless.</p>
<p>This book has really inspired me to look closer into the reasons why things as subtle and seemingly irrelevant as numbers trigger such an emotional reaction.  I am highlighting the meanings behind, and the imporance of, the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5 (which, coincidentally, are the first numbers of the Fibonacci sequence).  These are the numbers that I think are the most important in design, especially when grouping elements.</p>
<p><strong>One:</strong> The number one represents an individual item, but also the "whole"; everythingness. It represents our beginning (whatever you choose to believe is the beginning, whether it is the first amoebic life on this earth, a specific creator, being, or diety, the beginning of the universe, etc). It is important to remember that "in order to perceive "one", a field of nothingness is necessary." Therefore, ONE single item that you'd like to stand out needs to be displayed amongst things that have a similar contrast to the background, fonts that are a lighter weight, or just stark nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>Two:</strong> Two is a very symbolic number. It is the origin of lots of religious symbols in particular.  The yin-yang is based on two--showing opposites that are interdependent. Two is best used when trying to demonstrate high tension in design, or strong partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Three:</strong> Three is probably the most important number in design because it's roots are biological in nature--three is a very pleasing number to group elements in because it signifies completion.  Everything has a beginning, middle, and an end. The color we see is based on three--light wavelengths are based on three components and the ways they reflect or blend. In math, three is the first number to represent a plane or surface (one is just a point, two is a line). It also signifies balance. </p>
<p><strong>Five:</strong> Five is the number of the human element.  It is relateable, foundational, and represents quintessence or the "fifth element". To be used in navigation most effectively.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/orderingdisorder.html">Ordering Disorder: Grid Principles for Web Design</a></h3>
    	<h4>July 01, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>Ordering Disorder</em> by Khoi Vinh is similar to a lot of the other design books I've read during my apprenticeship. Most of its content relates to the grid structure and designing a website.  It also gives a list of steps that can be followed when executing a design.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on research and sketching. Vinh maintains that most of a designer's time should be spent in the research and sketching/planning process as opposed to in the coding process.  For me personally, this is really sound advice--I tend to start hacking away at code, changing things here and there to reflect what I'm seeing in my mind's eye.  I have never really felt any need to step up my planning game until working for 8th Light.  Now, I see its importance.</p>
<p>Good design is measured by how well it responds to the original problem, not how pretty it is, or how the color flows, or how intuitive the UX may be (though, those things may be solutions to an overall problem). This is why so much time should be spent in thoughtful study & brainstorming how to create a solution to a company's problem.  This is also where restraints should be considered, including technical, business, and content/editorial restraints.</p>
<p>Vinh also indicates that sketching is super important; not just in the beginning of your project, but throughout, as an easy/cheap way to brainstorm and test solutions.  Making Illustrator mockups at this point just won't cut it--he says to stick to pencil and paper for your first iterations, and then switch to more detailed sketches and mockups later on in the process. </p>
<p>The rest of the book beyond the Process section is all about Execution.  Here, you are taken step-by-step through the design of the Designery.us project, which helps the reader understand the practical application of what was only just touched on in earlier chapters.</p>
<p>Though similar to a lot of other books I've utilized in my apprenticeship, this book deserves a slot in my toolbox.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/scna.html">Software Craftsmanship North America Website Redesign</a></h3>
    	<h4>June 25, 2013</h4>
		    <p><img src="/blog/images/scna2012.png">
<p><a href="http://adamkaplandesign.com">Adam Kaplan</a> (the other design apprentice) and I gave the SCNA website a little facelift.  The website was originally done by <a href="http://nickmeccia.tumblr.com">Nick Meccia</a>  did <a href="http://scna2012.softwarecraftsmanship.com">the website</a> from last year.  It was super great, but we were asked to update it and change it to reflect current web trends and new web standards/practices. So, we broke the site up into sections to put emphasis on both our own creative potential, on the speakers, and on the attendees!</p>
<a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.com"><img src="/blog/images/scna2013.png"></a>
<p>The page is written in Hiccup, which is a templating language for Clojure.  Adam took over most of the structural components and transferred the existing information over from the SCNA 2012 site, put up the new speakers, bios, schedule, and venue information.  I did what I do best and created some fun icons/badges for the front page, and paired with Adam to organize the contents and get the forms up an running.  It was a great experience in teamwork and remote pair programming as well. Obviously, it's not the ideal situation to be in and we probably would have gotten it completed in a shorter time if we were in the same office, but it worked out all the same and our client left happy, which is what matters most.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/passionateprogrammer.html">The Passionate Programmer</a></h3>
    	<h4>June 23, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</em> is a book whose chapters are written as "tips", giving it a more casual, friendlier feel than many guides to a programming career.  It is meant to be an answer or even rebuttal to <em>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</em>, a book talking about becoming a programmer or advancing in your programming career "by coincidence". The author of the book is also a musician, creating some interesting parallels between that and programming.</p>
<p>Like most of the "career advice" books I've been reading through my apprenticeship, this one offers frank but humerous advice like "Love it or Leave it," and "Don't Listen to Your Parents," ideas suggesting picking risk over security and pursuing only what you love the most, and not settling for less. These points, among others, are what really stood out to me.</p>
<p><strong>Coding Don't Cut it Anymore</strong>: Just doing what you do isn't enough. You must strive to become the master of your profession.</p>
<p><strong>Be The Worst</strong>: If you're the worst you're sure to be surrounded by the best, from whom you can learn and vibe off of, thus making your work better and stronger. Emulation is inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Generalist</strong>: Be able to do many things. Don't just "graphic design", don't just "program". Know how to do a little of each. Generalists are rare and precious.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Specialist</strong>: ..but be a specialist in at least a few things. Be a master of these few things and have a deeper, more intimate understanding of them.. but still know how to do other things that are not <em>those</em> things.</p>
<p><strong>Right Now</strong>: Don't give yourself the option to put things off.  Do things <em>right now</em>. A sense of urgency will increase productivity.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/chicago.html">Chicago</a></h3>
    	<h4>June 17, 2013</h4>
		    <p><img src="/blog/images/chicago/nightcity.JPG"><p>Two weeks ago, myself and four coworkers traveled to visit our home office in Chicago. It was my first time experiencing flying after what I will affectionately refer to here as the "Baltimore Flying Fiasco of 2011". Of course, as most people do, I learned it was not that bad and really quite great.  After two and a half hours, we were in a completely different and uniquely beautiful place, so it was all well worth it.</p>
<p>We stayed in a hotel relatively close to work. The first night we got in late--around 10:30 PM--and we still had to fetch water, chapstick, and other small comforts for our hotel rooms. This gave us an opportunity to get a glimpse of the beautiful city all lit up at night.</p>
<p>I awoke in the morning quite early (5:00 am, baby!) because of the time difference, and was greeted by a beautiful sunrise over the skyscrapers. The reflective surfaces of all those immense buildings made it seem like the pink clouds went on forever.  The picture does it no justice, really. It was gorgeous.</p>
<img src="/blog/images/chicago/balcony1.JPG" width="730px">
<img src="/blog/images/chicago/city.JPG">
<p>We saw lots of amazing sights just on our walk into work on the first day. </p>
<p>Throughout our visit, we got to go to some really cool places to eat including the French Market which had several different vendors selling all kinds of food.  There was a fresh fruit smoothie place, a korean place (I got bulgogi), French food, fresh fish and meats, organic vegetables, a raw/vegan bar, and sushi! There was no shortage of amazing stuff. Our first night, we went out to enjoy drinks (well, not me) and foie gras (yes, me!) It was delightful. </p>
<p>Seeing how immense the city really is was the most amazing thing to me as a first time Chicago goer.</p>
<p>We worked with new people and at the end, got to go on a company bike ride through town. We got to see Lake Michigan and feel the amazing cool breeze blowing from the northeast that a storm two nights prior brought over.</p>
<img src="blog/images/chicago/bike.JPG" class="big-img">
<p>Most of this post is about the touristy aspect, I know. But we gained a lot of insight and learned so much more about our company in the process.  Meagan and I had so much fun working in the office and being able to just grab someone if we needed a second set of eyes for something. All the designers hung out in a conference room and bounced ideas off each other the whole week. It was so refreshing being able to be in the same environment as people doing the same thing I'm doing--I love my programming coworkers, but we designers think so much alike. Definitely an awesome experience.</p> </p>

    <h3><a href="/partnershipproject.html">Partnership Project</a></h3>
    	<h4>June 03, 2013</h4>
		    <p><a href="/projects/school-registration/index.html"><img src="blog/images/screenshot.png">
<a href="/projects/school-registration/index.html"><img src="blog/images/screenshot2.png"></a>
<p>I know I've mentioned a little about the partnership project I've been working on with Justin. To debrief again: I was tasked with building a site that a parent could access to be able to register their child. The parent would then be able to pull their information from the database and edit it, if need be.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this project, the parameters have evolved, as they often do when a client's needs grow and change.  From this initial concept has grown a dashboard page which I am very fond of--employing flat design and my penchant for color, I created a columned layout where hypothetical parents can access their child's information and even add new children conveniently from the same page. I used understated iconography and beautiful, subtle CSS transitions to get the point across.</p>
<p>I am excited for the next stages of my project. The next stage will be building a screen where a child can be added/edited from the dashboard instead of having to go to a completely different registration page.  After that, I am hoping to add some jQuery for a rolodex effect on mobile. I don't want to do anything too flashy since I want it to conform to real life needs.. a school most likely wouldn't implement fancy transitions and other such details, since most of their clientele may not be 100% tech savvy, or the expensive work may be lost on them.</p>

    	<h4>June 03, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>It's funny to look back on my projects and posts and see the feelings I was going through and the things I was struggling with. They all seem pretty trivial now. I went back and read about semantic HTML and making progress bars with CSS, and laughed aloud at how much better I have gotten, and not just with comptuer-related stuff.</p>
<p>I used to just freeze and procrastinate on things when I didn't know how they worked; fearing I wouldn't be able to get them done, or get them done on time.. fearing I would mess it up or no one would like it. Now, I am much more eager to learn new things and am more open to, and capable of, absorbing this new information. When pairing with folks in my office, my fingers fly across the keys--sometimes, I know exactly which CSS trick to try to get things working again. I am so proud of myself when I can easily come up with a solution for a coworker. It makes me feel more a viable part of our team.</p></p>

<p>The school registration page is coming along just fine. It is really all about the iterative process--delivering a minimum viable product and adding value every day, week, month..</p>
<img src="/blog/images/tictactoe.png"><p>I am also working on projects with other Tampa apprentices. I'll be working on a tic-tac-toe interface with Chong, and working on a site with Adam for some security talks he will be doing. I also recently found out I'll be redesigning the SCNA website, which is both an honor and a terror! I have tons of ideas, though, so I know I'll make something totally bad ass.</p>
<p>Miami this weekend for a much needed break. ^^ I'll be going on a private feeding tour with a friend of mine from zookeeping school who works in the Zoo Miami aviary. On Sunday, I'll be heading to Fairchild Botannical Gardens where they have a plant show and sale. Hoping to find some cool stuff for the backyard.</p>

    <h3><a href="/maychalkwall.html">May's Chalk Wall</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 29, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>This is a picture of the chalk wall I did for May. </p>
<img src="/blog/images/maychalkwall.JPG">
<p>As you can see, I have a lot of improving to do. You can also see that I am not quite tall enough to reach the ceiling, and most of the work is done at eye level. Haha.</p>
<p>I don't have a ton of experience with chalk walls so these have been really good practice. My biggest issue with the wall is allowing for enough white space/being able to draw super tiny to deliver a lot of detail while still keeping each element pretty small and allowing breathing room. To remedy this, we went ahead and got chalk markers which should afford a little more precision and will allow me to draw things in better detail, at smaller sizes.</p>
<p> This is something I've been learning with my web-based projects as well; I am making it a point to spend a lot more time in the planning stages instead of just "going for it".. Hopefully that helps. I can tell that I am getting better and learning how to maintain the wall & getting better at detail work. </p>
<p>Another issue that I've been experiencing is the texture of the wall. It is drywall, but seems to have a slight texture to it, either from bad drywall repair or just texturing when the building was built. Either way, the texture makes it really hard to draw straight lines, shade, etc. A bare drywall would work best for a chalk wall, with three to four coats of the paint applied to have a nice, thick, durable surface.</p>
<p>Cleaning and maintaining the wall is a bit of a chore. I assumed it'd be just like when I was in elementary school--the felt erasers that you would clap together and be shrouded by a white chalk cloud. Not the case. With a chalk wall, water is indicated for erasing. Partial erasures are messy and smear, leaving a film that can only be removed by really soaking the wall, which I imagine is not great for the paint. A super large sponge is the best since you can get a lot of water onto the wall at once and immediately run the sponge back over to absorb and take off the chalky residue. Obviously, we don't have a perfect system yet, but we're getting there through trial and error.</p></p>

    	<h4>May 22, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>These are some mockups I did for my IPM today. I am still working on the school registration project. The shot on the left is the control panel, while the shot on the right is the main registration form.</p>
<img src="/blog/images/mockups.png">
<!-- more -->
<p>The registration form page is something we decided not to go with.  My original idea in this project is for the form to be a two-column thing, so I am going to stick with that.  The control panel, however, is an idea Justin came up with, and I really like how it turned out.</p>
<p>Another fun part of this project was making the logo for "Hillsborough Pigeon Preparory School".. ha. Glad to be able to inject a little bit of what I am best at into an otherwise sometimes tedious & slightly intimidating project.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/jekyllreadmore.html">Jekyll Read More Functionality</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 22, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Jekyll was completely new to me when I started this apprenticeship, and I find that I still struggle with it sometimes; there are so many possibilities that is met with a startling lack of documentation or resources for people just starting out. Perhaps I can start to get my list of tips and tricks together to make a little more beginner-friendly blog post. But that's later.</p>
<p>So, ever since my <a href="/usertesting.html">user testing</a> project where I first engaged in testing my blog layout with my coworkers, I have been wanting to add a "Read More.." link to the projects page of my blog so that only an image would appear on the "front", and you could have the option of clicking to read more about my experience in making the project. However, the documentation available online is sparse and I really just wanted to be able to figure it out myself. I pushed this to the back burner while I dealt with more high-priority things, but when I saw <a href="http://meaganewaller.github.io">Meagan's</a> new blog layout, I saw she had added "Read more.." links to hers! </p>
<p>So, the way she did it was by replacing <code> {{ post.content }}</code> with <code>  {{ post.excerpt }} </code>. This was supposed to tell Jekyll to create an excerpt from the available text. Of course, abiding by Murphy's Law, this method did not work for me, so I had to hop on the dreaded Google and do some more research.</p>
<p>I did find some more helpful articles, <a href="http://metaclaws.com/2012/03/03/jekyll_post_excerpts_plugin_and_also_without_a_plugin_for_use_on_github_pages/">one of which</a> really helped to explain this to me in a way I could understand.  It was important to find something that I could really understand and be able to implement without it being a huge headache for my non-programmery mind. So, this is the solution that worked for me: on my index pages, instead of putting <code> {{ post.content }}</code>, I replaced it with <code>{{ post.content | split: '&#60;!-- more -->' | first }}</code>, making sure to put a link beneath it that'll navigate to the permalink where the user will be able to read the rest of the article.  This lets the index pages split your articles wherever the <code>&#60;!-- more --></code> comment appears.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/timemanagement.html">Time Management & Estimation</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 21, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>It is tremendously hard to find balance at this point of my apprenticeship, in almost every aspect of life. I know when I first started, I was having trouble keeping up with housework, keeping up with my relationships, having "me" time, and balancing client work. Obviously, this is to be expected when starting a new position that demands much more from you than any other position has. Balance at the workplace even tends to be a struggle, because of the focus on estimation.</p>
<p>Estimation is a huge thing at 8th Light. We use Artisan, an internal tool that allows us to calculate how much time we think a project will take in "points". There are two points in a day--so, one point for roughly four hours of work. Being as close to your estimate as possible is the goal--but with my partnership project, I have been off every time. Which sucks--if you miss one story in an iteration, you can't complete the iteration. You can't bill the client. And the company doesn't make money.</p>
<p>Another aspect that I find both familiar and intimidating is working on the design of several projects at once. I am used to doing this to a certain extent because of the work I've done in the past--I'd typically work on anywhere from 3-5 projects at once. Unfortunately, I have to admit that juggling several tasks at once is not my strong suit--I always end up wanting to play favorites and pay more attention to one or the other, and it leaves me feeling like I need to play catchup on the other less-loved tasks.</p>
<p>So, for now, I know of a couple things I have to do to make my estimates more accurate: I have to use visualization to figure out how much time something will realistically take me, and I have to break bigger parts into several smaller stories. This is the only way I will keep from feeling completely overwhelmed, and will be able to feel more success rather than failure, helping me out in the emotional department as well.</p>
<p>I'll also obviously need to start keeping a book or organized post-it notes section on my desk to be able to partition time during the day to devote to the different projects I have on my plate. This shouldn't be too hard; I used to subscribe to the post-it method and found it rather helpful. I know a lot of people at work use the pomodoro technique, but I'm not sure I'm disciplined enough to actually put it to use.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is something I need to work on, and will only get better at with practice.</p>

    	<h4>May 10, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>I am approaching the middle of my apprenticeship, which is really exciting.  For the rest of my apprenticeship, I will be doing mock client projects and working on internal applications that we use at 8th Light.  Since I was doing freelance work before coming to 8th Light (and still work on some select projects), I do have a significant amount of client experience, and consider it to be one of my strengths. Making someone's dreams and ideas come to fruition is exhilirating for me, even with the more "difficult" clients that I've had.</p><img src="/blog/images/wireframesketch.JPG" width="400px" height="auto">
<p>My first client simulation project is to produce a page that a parent can use to begin registering their child in elementary school. The site should allow the parent to input some personal information, and the informaion necessary for their child to be registered in school.  The site should also allow this information to be saved on a database for editing later.</p>
<p>I am really excited to get started on this project.  Most school and government websites are antiquated, nonresponsive, and nondescript. I am looking forward to making something modern and fresh with some personality, but that is also straightforward and simple to use for people who aren't super experienced with computing.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/catering.html">8th Light University: Catering</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 09, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Our main office is located in Downtown Chicago Illinois: a hotbed of culture and great food and personality and tradition.  Innovation runs rampant and population dense in the city's center.  Finding unique, fun food for 8th Light Universities would be great with so many diverse options.</p>

<p>North Tampa is a hard place to find good, unique food. It is a prime example of suburban sprawl--almost everything is a chain restaurant, and at least a 10 minute drive. It is even harder to find places that are willing to cater or deliver pretty large quantities of food. So, I was presented with a challenge.</p>

<p>For our 8th Light Universities, we are typically forced to order bland, predictable, and uninspired food. Jimmy John's and Jason's Deli are some of our go-to places. But there are some problems with this.</p>

<ul>
	<li>These are chain restaurants.</li>
	<li>Offer the same kind of food--a small variety of 4-5 sandwiches.</li>
	<li>Questionable/unknown quality.</li>
	<li>No evidence of "craftsmanship".</li>
</ul>

<p>The way I proposed to change this is to stick with our actual budget (far more than what we were spending), and to use only local places. It was important to find places where we could be sure the food is good quality (we'd been there before, or have even had multiple good experiences), and that also exemplify good craftsmanship. </p>

<p>So, I procured a small collection of about ten or so restaurants to cycle through and try.  They are all local, non-chain establishments, all places I've been multiple times and really enjoyed, and things that I know everyone really likes. I also found a few food trucks that I think we could get to come out and cater for us! I am really excited to share my selections, and hope that it inspires more attendance to our 8th Light Universities!</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/hierarchy.html">Hierarchy</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 07, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Hierarchy is something I have been seeming to struggle with through the duration of my apprenticeship. When Nick was in town a couple of weeks ago, we had a brief discussion about the importance of hierarchy, and how I can establish good hierarchy early on--in the planning stages of my projects. I did take his words to heart, but I am not sure that I am "getting it" just yet.</p>
<p>Art is subjective, but design is not. Every set of eyes is pleased by lines of text, images, or glyphs, represented using spacing and sizes determined by (sometimes) complex mathematical equation and formuli. Design is why we can like how something looks, but we're not sure why. Well, chances are, it has something to do with size and space.</p>
	<blockquote>
		"Big type, even huge type, can be beautiful and useful.  But poise is usually far more important than size, and poise consists primarily of emptiness." Robert Bringhurst, Canadian poet and typographer.
	</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to form an argument against that statement, especially seeing so many websites nowadays that make use of generous whitespace. We cannot put a finger on why we like that paragraph floating around in space so much, but we do.</p>
<p>Anyway, I planned for about a day and a half for the project I am working on now. It is crucial for this project to be spaced correctly and beautifully, as it is a project dealing with web type. More specifically, the art of web type. Using hierarchical rules and perfect poise is of utmost importance, and something I have thought through very carefully. Though I do not strive for perfection, I at least hope for some improvement as a result of my hard work.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/usertesting.html">User Testing</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 26, 2013</h4>
		    <p><img src="/blog/images/usertesting.JPG"><p>Last week, I read the book <em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> by Steve Krug.  My project was then to take something that I've made and conduct a little study with some of my coworkers to see how its usability might be improved.  I decided just to use my blog since it is the gateway to all of my other projects. </p>
<p>I created a questionnaire based on my readings from last week. Here are examples of some of the questions that I used.</p>
<pre>
<p>1. What is the first thing you see on the page?
<p>2. Can you tell the difference between blog/project section? How?
<p>3. Can you quickly differentiate the different parts of the blog/posts (title, date, post content, header, etc)?
<p>4. How does the color scheme make you feel?
<p>5. Is the content easy to read?
<p>6. How would you get to my most recent project?
</pre>
<p>I quickly found out from this project that my blog felt really clumsy to everyone. I have a lot of content as well, so a pretty common comment was "I just feel lost on the page if I scroll down any." Totally valid point! Even though everyone I queried were programmers, they clued me in to things that I didn't realize before.</p>
<p>Armed with tons of notes taken on my little survey, I started to make minor changes in color and in font. Like <em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> suggests, I made little tweaks all the while checking with my participants instead of making a major overhaul which would have taken way more time than necessary. I ended up making the header area much smaller and in fixed position so that you'd never feel "lost"---you'd always know what page you're on. I then presented it again to one of my test participants. I found that, yes, usability was much better, but there were still some things that arose even after the changes I'd made.</p>
<p>I went back and tweaked a few more elements. I added a small downward-pointing triangle to the top navigation bar to rest under the section of the page you were on, so you'd know what you were looking at. Before, I had just highlighted either "blog page" or "project page," which wasn't enough indication. I changed the font of my name to give a little more variety.  I also changed the color scheme on the projects page and removed the buttons; another common comment was that the colors clashed and were kind of an eyesore.</p>
<p>I presented the final product to everyone and noticed a marked improvement on how they responded to my blog page. They were much quicker navigating it and all commented on how much they liked the top navigation bar.  The change in layout for mobile devices was also something that everyone really liked as well.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/apprenticeship.html">Apprenticeship</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 23, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Some say that excellent work comes from passion, and some say excellent work comes as a result of great skill. Whatever "house" you belong to, it is a given that good work comes from dedication and preserverence, confidence and determination. </p>
<p>During last week when Nick was in town, we had a discussion about his apprenticeship, specifically the week of his challenges. What he said to me was very profound: scary, yet comforting. He told me his challenges week was one of the most stressful and trying weeks, that he'd tried his hardest, and was convinced that he was just not good enough. Yet, he was okay with that fact. He knew that his hardest was the best he could do, and with that fact, he was completely content and at peace. He did not stress, he did not fret. And he was offered a position.</p>
<p>We all want to be an expert in the one thing we put all of our time and effort into. At least, if you are the kind of person I am -- ambitious and curious and hungry to a fault. I think that part of my challenge here at 8th Light is to let go of fear: the fear that I am not good enough, the fear that I will make a fool of myself, the fear that I will fail. I have to bring myself to see that nothing I do here can be considered failure--I am going through a learning and growing process.</p>
<p>Nick also talked to me about one of our company's founders, Micah, who was coincidentally also Nick's mentor when he was an apprentice. Nick told me that Micah expects excellence from everyone -- not perfection or intellegence or anything really mesurable -- but excellence, the marriage of qualities mentioned above: dedication, preserverence, confidence and determination.  Things that you may not be born with, but things that you make the conscious decision to have or not to have. This is what our leader values most -- people who work hard to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>With this reminder, I am preparing myself to work harder than ever for the final months of my apprenticeship. I hope to write thorough and insightful blog posts, produce projects that "wow" and are representative of my skill, passion, and newfound skills. I strive to excel in professionalism and empathy, and cultivate fruitful partnerships with my coworkers in preparation for my final challenges. When they come, I strive to be ready!</p></p>

 <a href="/projects/jqueryclock/index.html"><img src="/blog/images/clock.png"></a>
 
<!-- more -->
<p>For my Javascript project, I was asked to make a clock that a user would be able to set, start, and stop, with buttons that indicated which "mode" it was in.</p>

<p>I have not written a line of Javascript ever. I was really open to the idea of learning, but was not aware of how hard it would be, and how much patience it would require. Wow. It was like being asked to learn a completely different language on the fly, in another country, completely alone. It's frustrating because not only do you not know how to get around the country, but you have no idea how to articulate what you're doing there, where you're trying to go, and your translation dictionary is completely inefficient, not to mention hard to use in urgent situations. While that seems like an extreme exmample, that's kind of how I felt.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was not completely alone. My mentor, Justin, was happy to help and showed me how to write most of the simple program that operates the clock. From there, I was able to piece some parts together and be able to exercise some more logic. I won't say I have the hang of Javascript--it's quite far from that, really--but I am a little more confident with the logic and navigating/modifying existing code.</p></p>

    	<h4>April 20, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>It has almost been three months since I started at <a href="http://8thlight.com">8th Light</a>, so just about the halfway mark of my apprenticeship. What better way to commemorate this milestone than to get a visit from one of the design craftsman!? I was so happy to finally be meeting one of the people I talk to every morning during standup.</p>
<p>Nick Meccia is one of our awesome craftsmen, and I think we fit the same mold---we love concentrating on how things look and how they make people feel. It was super fun to be able to sit next to Nick and have him explain some of his critiques to me! It's hard to communicate these things over e-mail so it was great to get hands-on instruction and pairing.</p>
<p>I look forward to going to Chicago to experience the office up there. I am certain it will mean lots of hours of learning and being immersed in the 8th Light culture, which I am too excited about! Plus, that will mean seeing a huge city, literally the biggest I have ever seen, bigger than my hometown of Miami! I am a little intimidated but know it'll be so worth it.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/rocketsurgery.html">Rocket Surgery Made Easy by Steve Krug</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 19, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Usability testing is a method of seeing the way your project is used & interacted with "in the wild," as a way of understanding how to make it easier.  There are both quantitative ("is this release easier than last release?") and qualitative methods (more informal, not trying to prove anything specific) of doing such.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>Using test participants other than yourselves or coworkers works because everyone encounters usability issues. These issues are easy to find (though not always obvious to the person creating the app, site, or program), and watching users will make you a smarter, more thoughtful designer. </p>

<h1>When?</h1>
<p>Simply, as soon as possible. Being able to implement helpful feedback in the early days of a project will help avoid costly, sometimes irrepairable problems down the road. It doesn't matter if you have a finished project. It doesn't matter if your app or site has polish.  What matters is that you can find users along the way to show you whether or not you're going in the right direction---and to keep heading in that direction.</p>
<p>If necessary, you can perform the "napkin test" on the fly, where you may draw any one feature of your site or app for another person's inspection. Ask questions like, "What do you think this is supposed to be?", and hopefully the response will be that it looks like a home page, or a checkout screen, or whatever it is you've portrayed.</p>
<p>With testing actual wireframes, you can ask more about process. Give the test participant the wireframe and pose the question, "How would you do x?", or "How do you find y?" Wireframes are ideal for testing the clarity of your navigation and how you've named things.</p>

<h1>Whom?</h1>
<p>Of course, it's obvious that you'll want to test a diverse audience, but there's more to it than that.</p>
<p>You will want individuals with domain knowledge (realtors if you have a real estate app, medical professionals if you have a drug search app or something similar), but you'll also want some participants with none. This offers you an equally valuable outside perspective. You will surely want to include people that reflect your target audience.</p>
<p>This book suggests testing three users for every round of testing. Three seems like a small number, but just three will be able to point out your major problems while keeping cost and hassle down. It's more important to have multiple rounds of testing throughout the creation of your app rather than tons of people and one round of testing.</p>

<h1>How?</h1>
<p>As a facilitator, you will not only be the liason between your company/product and the participant, but you will also act as a tour guide and therapist. Your goal is to externalize the participant's thought process, which is no small feat. During this time, you must remain neutral--resist the urge to provide the participant with clues as to how to use the product.</p>
<p>Your debriefing should not last long and should only cover the most important usability issues. Fixes should be made by the next round of testing, and should only be the smallest, simplest change needed to keep the issue from happening. The emphasis should be on tweaking the existing design, rather than a complete overhaul.</p>

<h1>Analytics Software vs. Usability Testing</h1>
<p>Software like Google Analytics is very valuable, there's no denying that--it shows you exactly where your users are spending their time on your website. However, nothing is as valuable as being able to see how the user is getting there.</p>

<h1>Usability testing in an agile environment</h1>
<p><em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> suggests just one morning out of the month dedicated to usability testing. For those of us who work with short iterations, we don't have to restrict ourselves to mornings, or to in-person usability testing. Though not preferrable and only to be done after doing in-person testing, remote testing can work well: you've a much more diverse population to choose from and the tests can be short, casual, and as informative as they would be in person.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/thecleancoder.html">The Clean Coder</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 14, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>The Clean Coder</em> is yet another book on my reading list by Bob Martin, similar to "Clean Code," which I read last week. However, I liked this one a lot better! I think it was a lot more relateable for a designer since there were no code samples, and all of what I read I could really relate to and take to heart. I am going to write bullet points outlining the things that really meant the most to me from this book. I am excited to take this new knowledge with me into the future of my career!</p>

	<li><strong>Professionalism</strong> is of utmost importance and can be very broadly summarized in three points: responsibility/accountability, cultivation of skills and professional development, and creating something that you are proud of showing off to the world--from both the front- and the back-end.</li>
	<li>A true <strong>professional</strong> finds four things to be of particular importance: practice, collaboration, mentoring, and humility, in no specific order.</li>
	<li>A <strong>professional</strong> is not obligated to say yes. However, you must work as hard as possible to be able to say yes. Teamwork is imperative when trying to find a solution to a problem.</li>	
	<li><strong>Pairing</strong> is one of the best way to get rid of "writer's block".</li>
	<li>"<strong>The Zone</strong>" is something to avoid, and is usually nothing more than a manic state wherein there is increased quantity, but not quality.</li>
	<li>Selectively attend <strong>meetings</strong>. If the meeting is necessary for the job you are doing now, attend. You are responsible for your own time management. </li>
	<li><strong>Iteration Planning Meetings</strong> should be quick and concise; if any one point takes longer than a few minutes to discuss, plan another time to discuss it more in depth. <strong>Demos</strong> should be held 45 minutes before the end-of-day on the last day of iteration.</li>
	<li>You only have a certain amount of "<strong>focus mana</strong>" per day. Some days it's more, sometimes it's less. Focus mana is a decaying resource, and it's best to use all of it, every day. It is important to know when to disengage.</li>
	<li><strong>Estimation</strong> is the middle ground between making a commitment (client's view) and guessing (programmer's view). It is not a number--rather, it is a distribution.</li>
	<li>There are three parts to making a <strong>commitment</strong>: saying you'll do it, meaning it, and actually doing it. Professionals do not make commitments they are not <em>absolutely certain</em> they can keep.</li>
	<li><strong>The PERT model</strong> allows you to break down your estimation into three parts: "O" is the optimistic estimate--if everything goes perfectly; "N" is a nominal estimate--the estimate with the greatest chance of success; and "P" is your pessimistic estimate--or if everything goes wrong, the longest it could possibly take for you to finish your project.</li>
	<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> is important. Team ownership of code gives everyone more of a feeling of camraderie and a sense of responsibility for upkeep, maintenance and improvement.</li>
	<li><strong>Teams</strong> are hard to build and establish, and will require some time to "ferment". Well-established teams can then go on to tackle all sorts of projects together, working efficiently. Establishing a successful team should always come before tackling projects.</li>
	<li>Only by being directly exposed to real-world scenarios will someone be prepared to deal with them. The <strong>apprenticeship</strong> model doesn't only work with skilled tradesmen like plumbers and electricians. Apprenticeship can be more valuable than a university education and will provide you with more-than-adequate skills and experience to enter the workforce, without all of the debt.</li>
	<li>You should learn just as much <strong>mentoring</strong> as you do independently learning--through teaching others, one has more understanding of the subject matter and enriches someone else's life at the same time.</li>
	<li><strong>Craftsmanship = professionalism</strong>. It is pride, skill, and confidence. It is approaching obstacles or issues with a clear mind, without avoidance. It is accepting responsibility. It is estimating accurately, knowing when to apologize, say no, and say yes.</li></p>

    <h3><a href="/cleancode.html">Clean Code</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 11, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</em> by Bob Martin is a book that you can judge by it's cover.</p>
<p>Out of this book, I was only instructed to read a few chapters since, as a designer, not all of them applied to the work that I do.</p>
<p>The book felt a little redundant to me after my reading of <em>Getting Real</em> from a week or so ago. They are, of course, two different books with completely different approaches to the same mindset. <em>Clean Code</em> gives code examples and details more the process of creating and maintaining a beautiful program, while <em>Getting Real</em> provides a general, easy-to-digest outline for agile development.</p>
<p><em>Clean Code</em> is a great book and I got a lot out of my reading that I can implement in my projects and future endeavors. Specifically, I enjoyed reading about naming, formatting, and organizing my code. Though conciseness and efficiency are two of my greatest intentions, this book teaches that using longer, more descriptive names is best.</p>
<p>The book's emphasis on clutter and avoiding duplication was also something I fouund particularly useful, especially since I am a minimalist in most things--posessions, home decor, etc.  Especially with HTML and CSS, this is terribly useful.  Using shorthand is one great way to reduce clutter.  Using already-declared HTML5 tags instead of making endless divs to accomplish the same thing is very helpful.  In your CSS, you'll want to be as descriptive as possible in naming your classes so that if someone else has to work in that same document, they will know which element is which.  Establishing a base class for several elements that share different styles also helps to keep the document concise, organized, and straightforward.</p>
<p>So, while it may not outwardly seem like a great book for designers and programmers both, the important thing is to pay attention to the general concepts which can be applied anywhere within the software-sphere.</p></p>

<a href="/projects/animations/index.html"><img src="/blog/images/animations.png"></a>

<!-- more -->

<p>My last reading was <em>Visual Grammar</em> by Christian Leborg. I was made fun of by my co-apprentice: "The books we have to read are four hundred pages and all words! You get to read picture books!" Indeed, this book did have a lot of whitespace, hardly any actual paragraphs, and very sparse words.  I was challenged in a different way--thinking, visualizing, and planning versus writing complex mathematical equations and algorithms. And I'm okay with that.</p>
<p>This project on CSS Animations was by far the hardest for me because, though I was not doing anything too terribly impressive, math in the form of coordinates and speed were added in addition to the usual font selection, positioning, spacing, and color choices I usually make.</p>
<p>I stuck to the red/black/white color scheme of the book for the most part, but added some mint in the footer and the top stripe detail in the very first window.  I also made it a point to try to work with "whitespace" in general, since it is not one of my strong suits.  I like efficiency and thus, try to fit as much as I can into every little area. I wanted to give each window/cell/div/whatever some breathing room so that the viewer could really concentrate on the focal points which were the animations and transitions.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this project is the last window about "weight". <strong>Weight</strong> is a theory that I really enjoy experimenting with because it can really affect the balance of a page and the way it's interpreted by the viewer. I took eight circles, made them all different sizes, and made them shoot up the page while simultaneously shrinking, hover for a bit in suspense, and then drop back down, growing to their original size.  I wanted to illustrate how size and object placement completely change the way something looks. I approached it this way because I wanted to give the illusion of rocks when the circles are at their base location, and then a constellation when hovering around the top (I even made one of the circles a different color, like in Orion's belt).</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/designersvsdevelopers.html">Designers vs. Developers</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 08, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Some things never change, even over time. The resilience of cockroaches. The shape of bread (for the most part). The fact that razors still haven't adapted to the shin bone or knee. The fact that, somehow, everyone forgets to RSVP to everything.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like these other things that have stood the test of time, in this industry we will always have some beef between "designers" and "programmers". Even in more modern times where the phrase "web developer" has been coined and niche carved, there still exists some polarity and as such, animosity. So, what's the big deal?</p>
<h1>Myth: Being a Designer is Easy</h1>
<p>This is not only degrading but, more importantly, very untrue. You know that quote by Einstein that has been completely overused (the one probably not even said by Einstein anyway)? "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Well, here, that holds a lot of truth. Confession time: I have never been great at math. Really, I hate it. Whenever I see numbers, I freeze up. It's not because I'm a woman, or because I'm dumb--it's just because I don't think that way. And, in a similar vein, logic and equations and parentheses freak me out. This is why I would not make a great programmer. </p>
<p>But consider what I <em>am</em> capable of and what I <em>am</em> good at doing--I am good at helping programmers develop something that a client will be pleased to see. I am good at thinking like a consumer and making things less frustrating for consumers to use. I can't tell you how many times I've heard programmers say something along the lines of, "I know it looks bad, but I can't tell you why." Well, <em>I</em> can tell you why, and I can work with you to find a great solution that won't break anything.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate my intellegence.  Instead, appreciate how I can help you deliver something that will be well-received by someone who doesn't understand all the back-end stuff you spent weeks doing, so that all your hard work doesn't go to waste.</p>
<h1>Cooperation and Communication Are Key</h1>
<p>Though we think differently, that doesn't mean we have to work differently or segregate ourselves within the same project.  Cooperation is key: communication, flexibility and adaptability are, and always have been, most valuable. With a programmin', designin' duo, cooperation is certianly not impossible. Pairing is great between designers and developers because changes can be made on-the-fly and things explained that otherwise would take days to get across. Plus, everyone learns something new! Score!</p>
<h1>The Unicorn</h1>
<p>"Designers" sometimes get a bad rap due to their more specialized peers: the kind of designers that live in Photoshop, hardly know how to code (and don't think they should learn), give incomplete information (not providing a style guide, arbitratily choosing colors, sizes, margins, widths..), choose form over function, and take forever to produce anything (waterfall vs agile).</p>
<p>Though "there's always one", the number of professionals that are <em>not</em> like that is steadily growing. Now you have "unicorns", the crossover vehicles/jack-of-all-trades of the web world. These people typically place a high value on both logical/mathematical and spatial/artistic thinking, are up to date on web standards and practices, who are communicative and more open with sharing their knowledge, who work the agile way, who realize the imporance of brand continuity on various platforms/media, and are more quality individuals in general because they tend to place an emphasis on continuing education and personal growth. Fortunately, most of the pet peeves developers have about designers can be solved by having a good, well-rounded designer who is eager to learn. Really, we're all pieces of the same puzzle-being more of a generalist has its benefits.</p> 
<p>Having people like this around is great since programmers won't need to be bugged to make simple changes: a web developer will be able to navigate something like a <code>hiccup</code> document where there's both hiccup and clojure and will be able to tweak not only design elements, but will also be able to tackle bits of code.  These individuals are true Renaissance (wo)Men.</p>
<p>To close, here is a funny Tumblr I found, called <a href="http://devsdoart.com/">Devs Do Art</a>, a gallery of mostly wireframes or brainstorming sketches done by developers.</p></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>For this project, I worked on replicating something tabular from print or internet. I decided I'd do the NPR Show schedule, as I listen to the station religiously, and the schedule on their website is messed up. </p>
<p>Tables are really no big deal--they're all just about remembering the placement of other object around them. I used html5 tags in this project--<code>thead</code>, <code>tbody</code>, and <code>caption</code>. I also added some phone icons I downloaded from <a href="http://fontello.com">Fontello</a>, and positioned them relative to their starting positions within their compartments. Fortunately, their positions were all pretty similar, so it only took one tag to manipulate them.</p>
<p>I'd never worked with tables beyond a table-based layout (the greatest of faux pas!), but now I feel much more comfortable producing them to work with complicated tabular data.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/jekyll.html">Jekyll</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 05, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>My first apprenticeship task was to set up a blog using Jekyll and Github Pages, two completely foreign things with not a whooole lot of documentation behind them.  Though I barely managed and had lots of help, I have been able to both maintain the blog and make massive changes to its infrastructure.  Like anything, with exposure and a "dive in head first" mentality, learning is somewhat easy. Google searches also help.</p>

<p>Lately, I have been issues with my blog. First, the posts weren't showing up in the right "sections". Next, the images stopped working. Then, the layout.html/styles.css files weren't working. What gives? First, know a couple things about the way my blog is set up.</p>

<p>The way my blog works is that I have two blogs within one. Confusing? Sure. But it works.</p>

<pre>
|--_config.yml
|--_includes
|--_layouts
|  |--default.html
|  |--post.html
|--blog
|  |--index.html
|  |--_posts
|  |  |--2012-04-06-hello-world.md
|--projects
|  |--index.html
|  |--_posts
|--index.html
</pre>
<p>Each section should have its own folder, wherein you'll have an index.html, a _posts folder, and perhaps some other folders (although not necessary): css, images, etc. You'll have two different html files in the layouts folder, and you'll direct to them from the yaml front matter included in all of the posts.</p>
<p>Yaml is touchy. I learned this the hard way. My posts were in their respective sections (the _posts folder of each "separate" blog) and I was updating everything just as I should. So, what was the problem?</p>
<p>Punctuation. Punctuation was all the problem. This is something I never would have been able to figure out myself, because I do not think like a programmer. I am not hard wired to question the punctuation in anything, where it's placed, or what it could mean. All I know is that gramatically, it makes sense, and so I'm using it.</p>
<p>At the top of every blog post you'll put in the "_posts" folder, you'll have some Yaml that will tell the post how it will be laid out, where it is going on the page, and what the title and date are.  These are all user-specified.  If there is any punctuation in these, it will mess up.  I had a post in my blog/_posts/ folder whose title contained a colon. That little colon completely derailed my blog.</p>
<h1>So, how did I find the error?</h1>
<p>Run <code>jekyll --no-auto --server</code>, which specifically tells you where your errors may be, the file name/location, and line number. It'll also let you know which character is throwing a wrench into the delicate innerworkings of your site. Pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Erasing the _site directory is another thing that you might want to do as well if you're encountering problems like this. That'll ensure that you're working from a clean slate if you have any corrupt files, and will help to avoid having to make changes to a bunch of files.</p>

<p>For this assignment, I was to find a magazine article with different elements and text styles to markup with semantic HTML and CSS styling.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge (if you can call it that) was just tweaking numbers to make sure the proportions matched those of the actual article. It helped being able to see them side by side, and I was able to achieve the styles by using simple borders, some padding, and icon fonts.</p></p>

<p>CSS Positioning is something I have mixed feelings about, as you might be able to tell from my most recent project.  It's a powerful layout tool, allowing elements to interact with one another in ways that can improve the flow of your document.</p>
<p>Positioning, however, can be one of those things that, when done in excess, it makes your CSS into a minefield--it needs constant tweaking and you're always in fear of completely disrupting everything on your site. It's a maintenance nightmare.</p>
<p>So, in my project, I highlighted the best uses for each of the positioning properties and also used them sparingly, more to highlight information and give useful tips.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/gettingreal.html">Getting Real</a></h3>
    	<h4>March 26, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>I just finished up reading <em>Getting Real</em> by <a href="http://37signals.com/"><em>37signals</em></a>. When I was first assigned this reading, I was told I'd have a lot to say about it.</p>
<p>But I don't. Here's why:</p>
<p>8th Light is the first software company I have ever worked for, besides working freelance. Therefore, I am somewhat of a blank slate. Several of my peers have the experience of working in massive companies, companies with management problems, companies that are not run by the principles outlined in this book.</p>
<p>Luckily, because I am such a "blank slate", agile development seems natural to me. As a freelancer, I worked like this without knowing it had a name. It just seems like the easiest way to operate efficiently and get things done. Talk to the customer often, make changes based on evolving needs while sometimes saying "no," and delivering parts of the project once they are ready.</p>
<p><em>Getting Real</em> is a book about more than just software development. It is a book that is accessible, easy to read, and simple to understand, even for people in different professions. </p>
<p>This book illustrates shedding excess and working with small steps rather than large, seemingly unattainable goals. It touches on creativity, and how it seems to flourish the more restrictions there are in place.  It emphasizes that it's okay for things to change during development, and that this change should be welcome. These are things that not only apply to software, but everything in life.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/handcraftedcss.html">Handcrafted CSS</a></h3>
    	<h4>March 15, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>8th Light is all about craftsmanship.  Doing something we are proud of doing & doing it with enthusiasm, passion, and skill. Dan Cederholm, author of <em>Handcrafted CSS</em> (and the creator of <a href="http://dribbble.com">dribbble</a>), is obviously a proponent of this same mindset, making this book an appropriate addition to my reading.  </p>
<p><em>Handcrafted CSS</em> does something important: it allows us to style things the way we want, while giving us tools to assure that these things degrade gracefully when being viewed with a lesser browser. Responsiveness and media queries are something that I have been learning about slowly through this apprenticeship, and they're obviously a consideration---making things that scale gracefully, no matter if it's on a big, small, or obsolete device. </p>
<p>While I like to think that I'd make something akin to a 404 error message for people with Internet Explorer ("Too bad, maybe you should upgrade to something relevant!"), for some clients, that is obviously not an option. In some occupations, it is common for users to still be booting up a Windows 98 computer and running Internet Explorer 6-8. While we may weep at this very idea, we must also accept it and adapt to it by coming up with new ways to display things the way we want.
<blockquote>"The critical distinction between a craftsman and an expert is what happens after a sufficient level of expertise has been achieved.  The expert will do everything she can to remain wedded to a single context, narrowing the scope of her learning, her practice, and her projects.  The craftsman has the courage and himility to set aside her expertise and pick up an unfamiliar technology or learn a new domain." </blockquote></p>

<p>This week I have been scrambling to play catch up with my apprenticeship since the week prior was dedicated to client work. I completed the <a href="/projects/box-model/index.html">box-object model project</a> around the beginning of the week, and completed my most recent project on inline & block elements on early Friday.
<p>Inline, block, and inline-block elements are not that difficult to understand, but pretty difficult to explain. I had a lot of fun exploring different color palettes this week, and discovering new ways to convey this sort of information to an audience. I can feel myself becoming more confident with my skills and being able to apply some things that I have been learning. </p>
<p>Friday we spent hosting our first 8th Light University at the Tampa office.  We had just been streaming Chicago's 8th Light University and inviting guests, but this will be so much more interactive and engaging with a live person talking and demonstrating.  We kicked it off with Cory Foy's talk on Arduino programming. I'd never heard of this little kit before working here, so it was really neat to see how easy it can be to make your own robot that can do all kinds of incredible things. My coworker, Will, told me about someone who programmed the robot to open litter box doors when it sensed cats approaching, close the doors when it sensed cats leaving, and then start the fan blowing to dissipate the smell! Completely awesome. 10 out of 10, would buy.
<p>This week I am going to try balancing client work and apprenticeship work so I don't fall so far behind on either. I should have a couple of book summaries up soon, and a project on CSS positioning.</p>

<p>Another project done, another several to go! :) Sometimes I feel like I am endlessly plugging away at yet another HTML document, carefully styled with CSS. It gets a little dedious and can be a litlte monotonous even though the content is changing quite a lot, but I know the repitition will help me with retaining the new skills I'm learning and refining.</p>
<p>My objective for this project was to design a concise guide to the CSS Box-Object Model. I found it fun and kind of challenging. I think the thing that is the hardest is taking my newfound knowledge and implementation of semantic HTML and putting it to use instead of using the usual nondescript and number-laden names for things. Giving things more descriptive titles and utilizing new HTML5 tags is definitely something I am learning through doing, and making a habit.</p></p>

		    <p><p>It has become increasingly hard trying to find a balance in my life between different projects and my personal life, though I realize it is something I must do. Learning discipline has been a priority for me in general, and now it's essential that I show I am capable of this balance.</p>
<p>Switching between client work and my apprenticeship projects is probably the hardest thing for me. It's great to be able to work on two drastically different things, but I find it hard to flip the switch in my brain between the two. This week I worked almost exclusively on client work, neglecting my apprenticeship projects.  Next week I will probably work a lot on apprenticeship projects just to catch up.</p></p>

<p>So, I originally had this project done on Friday, as was planned.  I felt "eh" about it, and my mentor, Justin, looked at it and pointed out a bunch of things that he disliked. It was clear that I wasn't super passionate and excited about the project, so I took it home to rectify that.</p>
<p>I trimmed everything down quite a bit and focused on making things responsive. I muted the colors significantly so that my blog wasn't in danger of being an eyesore, even on different displays.</p>
<p>Anyway, the project is pretty self-explanitory.  I was asked to asses my current skills and make the progress bars so that they could be edited to reflect how I've grown over the course of the apprenticeship.
<p>I used things I learned both through Handcrafted CSS and Craftsman Stephanie Briones' blog. I implemented figure and figcaption, both of which I'd never used before. Learning semantic tags in HTML5 is awesome and I know it makes my code so much cleaner. I am actually proud to show people what I've done now.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/semantichtmlmenu.html">Semantic HTML Menu</a></h3>

		    <p><a href="/../projects/semanticmenu/index.html"><img src="/blog/images/menu.png"></a>
<p>You can find the original menu <a href="/projects/semanticmenu/refinerymenu.pdf">here</a>. The Refinery is one of our favorite restaurants in Tampa and is well-known for changing their menu up weekly to reflect their fresh farmers' market finds.<p>
<p>My first non-blog-related project for my apprenticeship was to create a semantic HTML version of a restaurant menu.  CSS could be used for simple styles and positioning, but no images could be used. I would use HTML elements to make the code simple, and easy to read and comprehend.</p>
<p>While this project seems simple, it took a lot more thought than I figured it would require. <p>
<p>Teaching myself HTML and CSS was a bit of a trainwreck composed of hacking bits of code together and having it work--but just barely. So I knew that learning to write everything myself from top to bottom would be a real challenge. <p>

<!-- more -->

<p>For this project, I read <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/billy-whited/2011/10/17/expressive-html.html"> Expressive HTML</a> by Billy Whited. I basically started by just writing up a simple HTML document, as I normally would. It was funny to go back and see how the way that I write my HTML mimics the way I would hack different pieces of code together to make sites---disjoined and very ungraceful. I quickly learned that I hardly had any deep understanding of the languages I thought I knew.  With Justin's help, I was able to make my code more concise and flow a lot better. I feel like I have a more structured and thorough understanding. </p>
<p>I will end my post with a snippet from Billy's post that really summarized my experience:</p>
<blockquote>
	Expressive html isn’t fundamentally different from “regular” html. It’s not an abstraction. It’s not a new tool. It doesn’t seek to alter the basic vocabulary of the web’s common language.

    <h3><a href="/thedesignofeverydaythings.html">The Design of Everyday Things</a></h3>
    	<h4>February 08, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Next on my reading list was <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, by Donald Norman. The book was actually first published in the year I was born, but the ideas and principles in the book remain relevant.</p>

<p>As we move through our world, we are met with thousands of choices--most, if not all of which we are unaware. In my morning routine alone, I am met with hundreds of decisions based on the appliances and hardware that I am using. Using a coffee machine, faucets, doors and windows..</p>

<p>Obviously, detailing all the points of this book would be laborious.  Some of the points I found most interesting and helpful for our purposes were centered around making difficult things simple. In software design, we are tasked with putting hundreds of different functions into something that should look streamlined, friendly, while also being intuitive.  We expect people to know or understand how to do certain things, where to look next, how to get back to what they were doing before.. there are so many things to take into consideration when designing things that can essentially become such a huge part of someone's everyday life.</p>

<!-- more --> 

<p>A great example of this would be Apple products. Where having one button for every single function on an Apple device would become distracting, clunky, and cluttered, Apple utilizes intuitive gestures like flicking, pinching, spreading, and using multiple fingers for certain commands. It uses one of Don Norman's ideas--using both knowledge from the world and knowledge in the head.</p>

<blockquote>I have argued that people learn better and feel more comfortable when the knowledge required for a task is available externally--either explicit in the world or readily derived through constraints. But knowledge in the world is useful only if there is a natural, easily interpreted relationship between that knowledge and the information it is intended to convey about possible actions and outcomes. - Donald Norman, <em>The Design Of Everyday Things.</em></blockquote> 

<p>Apple's gestures perfectly illustrate this point. The gestures are natural to use because they mimic things we do outside of computing--say, flipping a page in a book or rotating a piece of paper on a flat surface. Gestures that we know well and have done before, sometimes without even realizing it, but things that just seem to make sense when applied in this way.</p>

I can already safely say that I have never liked a job more, or worked with people who are so smart, who I can relate to as much as I am now. People who I can talk to about anything I care about, and they just <em>get it</em>.</p>
<p>My first week here has just been getting handed books, given projects, and am learning about the team and the way the company works. It's true--you do learn a lot, and quickly. This week, I used Github for the first time and got super frustrated. My first project was diving head-first into things I am not comfortable with in the least. By the end of the week, I was told I'd be working on client work. Yeah, fast. I love it!</p><!-- more -->
<p>My task for the next two weeks was to create a blog to post my book reviews and my projects for reference and for others to see. I am told this blog will morph and change much during my apprenticeship, so I am starting with something very basic--just a one-column design with some watercolor elements that I will vectorize in Illustrator to make them transparent .pngs. I wanted something to show off my style but something that I'd be able to evolve over time.</p>
<p>The next book on my reading list is <strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong> by Donald Norman, so I will be posting an entry about that soon. </p></p>

		    <p><p>Typography holds a special place in my heart; its importance is undeniable, yet, it is often overlooked. Pinterest and Tumblr have popularized hand-lettering, helping people realize typography's role in computer- and print-based media.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking With Type</strong> by Ellen Lupton has been on my Amazon wish list for a while, so I was excited to learn that it'd be the first item on my reading list for my apprenticeship at 8th Light. I actually finished the book before my first day.</p>

<p>This book is an excellent resource; akin to how we'd use a dictionary to refer to words just within our grasp, but the true meaning escapes us. Thinking With Type delves into the deeper elements of typography, even past the letters, down into the most minute details like serifs, bowls, ascender and descender. The way Ellen Lupton describes type in the most sensual ways is really what gets me.</p><!-- more -->

<blockquote>"A well-designed comma carries the essence of the typeface down to its delicious details. Helvetica's comma is a chunky square mounted to a jaunty curve, while Bodoni's is a voluptuous, thin-stemmed orb."  -  Ellen Lupton, <em>Thinking With Type</em></blockquote>

<p>The book also covers numerous other type-related topics from kerning to utilizing the golden mean in creating a modular scale. <strong>Thinking With Type</strong> is an incredibly useful resource, and even has <a href="www.thinkingwithtype.com">a website</a> briefly covering all of the topics.</p></p>
