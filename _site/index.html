	  <h2><a href="/gettingreal.html">Getting Real</a></h2>
      <h4>March 26, 2013</h4>
    <p>Recently, I finished up reading <em>Getting Real</em> by <a href="http://37signals.com/"><em>37signals</em></a>. When I was first assigned this reading, I was told I'd have a lot to say about it.</p>
<p>But I don't. And here's why.</p>
<p>8th Light is the first software company I have ever worked for. Therefore, I am somewhat of a blank slate. Several of my peers have the experience of working in massive companies, companies with management problems, companies that are not run by the principles outlined in this book.</p>
<p>Luckily, because I am such a "blank slate", agile development seems natural to me. As a freelancer, I worked like this without knowing it had a name. It just seems like the easiest way to operate efficiently and get things done. Talk to the customer often, make changes based on evolving needs while sometimes saying "no," and delivering parts of the project once they are ready.</p>
<p><em>Getting Real</em> is a book about more than just software development. It is a book that is accessible, easy to read, and simple to understand. In fact, my boyfriend picked it up and read it when I'd left it at home one day. He is a nurse: not even close to being in the same industry. Yet, the book inspired him.</p>
<p>This book illustrates shedding excess and working with small steps rather than large, seemingly unattainable goals. It touches on creativity, and how it seems to flourish the more restrictions there are in place.  It lets you know that it's okay for things to change during development. Things that not only apply to software, but everything.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/handcraftedcss.html">Handcrafted CSS</a></h2>
      <h4>March 15, 2013</h4>
    <p>8th Light is all about craftsmanship.  Doing something we are proud of doing & doing it with enthusiasm, passion, and skill. Dan Cederholm, author of <em>Handcrafted CSS</em>, is obviously a huge proponent of this same mindset, making this book an appropriate addition to my reading.  
<p><em>Handcrafted CSS</em> does something important: it allows us to style things the way we want, while giving us tools to assure that these things degrade gracefully when being viewed with a lesser browser. Responsiveness is something that I have been learning about slowly through this apprenticeship, and is definitely a consideration---not only making things that are supported on smaller devices, but also making things that will be supported on older browsers. While I like to think that I'd make something akin to a 404 error message for people with Internet Explorer ("Too bad, maybe you should upgrade to something relevant!"), for some clients, that is obviously not an option. In some occupations, it is common for users to still be booting up a Windows 98 computer and running Internet Explorer 6-8. While we may weep at this very idea, we must also accept it and adapt to it by coming up with new ways to display things the way we want.
<blockquote>"The critical distinction between a craftsman and an expert is what happens after a sufficient level of expertise has been achieved.  The expert will do everything she can to remain wedded to a single context, narrowing the scope of her learning, her practice, and her projects.  The craftsman has the courage and himility to set aside her expertise and pick up an unfamiliar technology or learn a new domain." </blockquote>

	  <h2><a href="/balance.html">Balance</a></h2>
      <h4>March 01, 2013</h4>
    <p>It has become increasingly hard trying to find a balance in my life between different projects and my personal life, though I realize it is something I must do. Learning discipline has been a priority for me in general, and now it's essential that I show I am capable of this balance.
<p>Switching between client work and my apprenticeship projects is probably the hardest thing for me. It's great to be able to work on two drastically different things, but I find it hard to flip the switch in my brain between the two. This week I worked almost exclusively on client work, neglecting my apprenticeship projects.  Next week I will probably work a lot on apprenticeship projects just to catch up.
<p>That being said, I am having fun and learning a lot. Jekyll is a templating language for Clojure that I have been learning. Lots of brackets and parentheses.  But I am finding that it comes easier with practice (and mistakes).

	  <h2><a href="/morecsstweaks.html">More CSS tweaks</a></h2>
      <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
    <p>Lots of tweaks still today.  Lots of what I am doing with my self-evaluation is just making sure things flow well and the colors and fonts look good together. Right now, I am not going to worry about responsiveness because I am just starting to learn about it.</p>
<p> I am also going to be working on an <em>actual</em> client project which is very exciting, but becoming a top priority so I won't be able to do as many projects a week as I had planned.</p>
<p>Today, I also signed up for a couple of Skillshare classes that I think will help my design skills out a little.  I am taking a class on hand-lettering, and one on using pattern, texture, and color in illustrations. I have really been getting into both lately, and am happy to be able to share the resources with the rest of the design team.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/cssprogressbars.html">CSS Progress Bars</a></h2>
      <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
    <p>Today, for me, was all about CSS positioning and fun progress bars.  I am currently working on a project where I evaluate my skillset coming into the apprenticeship. I wanted to show this through progress bars that had a little bit of drop shadow detail, a little bit of text, and some cool blurred images in the background. I wanted to mimic a really cool layout style that I've seen before, and that my co-apprentice Adam Kaplan executed for his <a href="http://adamkaplandesign.com/position-properties.html" alt="Adam Kaplan Design: Position Properties">positioning project</a>.</p>
<p>I won't elaborate too much because I will have to complete this same project soon--but I had to use a bunch of new CSS that I'd never used before. It was fun to learn and looks great so far.  My goal is to have it complete by Thursday or so. It would be great to be done Wednesday, but.. we'll see.</p>

      <h4>February 09, 2013</h4>
    <p>My second week totally flew by!</p>
<p>Most of it was spent getting my blog up and doing more reading. Like I mentioned before, I got the chance to begin work on a client project, which was a little intimidating but still very exciting.</p>
<p>A bunch of books came in the mail that were supposed to get here Monday or Tuesday, so I'll be doing that this weekend! So excited; I love designer books since they're usually short, have a ton of pictures, and are always so beautiful.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/thedesignofeverydaythings.html">The Design of Everyday Things</a></h2>
      <h4>February 08, 2013</h4>
    <p>Next on my reading list was <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, by Donald Norman. The book was actually first published in the year I was born, but the ideas and principles in the book remain relevant.</p> 

<p>As we move through our world, we are met with thousands of choices--most, if not all of which we are unaware. In my morning routine alone, I am met with hundreds of decisions based on the appliances and hardware that I am using. Using a coffee machine, faucets, doors and windows..</p>

<img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5301/5638283158_21bbf92d00_z.jpg" class="leftwrap"><p>Obviously, detailing all the points of this book would be laborious.  Some of the points I found most interesting and helpful for our purposes were centered around making difficult things simple. In software design, we are tasked with putting hundreds of different functions into something that should look streamlined, friendly, while also being intuitive.  We expect people to know or understand how to do certain things, where to look next, how to get back to what they were doing before.. there are so many things to take into consideration when designing things that can essentially become such a huge part of someone's everyday life.</p>

<p>A great example of this would be Apple products. Where having one button for every single function on an Apple device would become distracting, clunky, and cluttered, Apple utilizes intuitive gestures like flicking, pinching, spreading, and using multiple fingers for certain commands. It uses one of Don Norman's ideas--using both knowledge from the world and knowledge in the head.</p>

<blockquote>I have argued that people learn better and feel more comfortable when the knowledge required for a task is available externally--either explicit in the world or readily derived through constraints. But knowledge in the world is useful only if there is a natural, easily interpreted relationship between that knowledge and the information it is intended to convey about possible actions and outcomes. - Donald Norman, <em>The Design Of Everyday Things.</em></blockquote> 

<p>Apple's gestures perfectly illustrate this point. The gestures are natural to use because they mimic things we do outside of computing--say, flipping a page in a book or rotating a piece of paper on a flat surface. Gestures that we know well and have done before, sometimes without even realizing it, but things that just seem to make sense when applied in this way.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/thinkingwithtype.html">Thinking With Type</a></h2>
      <h4>February 02, 2013</h4>
    <p>Typography holds a special place in my heart; its importance is undeniable, yet, it is often overlooked. Pinterest and Tumblr have popularized hand-lettering, helping people realize typography's role in computer- and print-based media.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking With Type</strong> by Ellen Lupton has been on my Amazon wish list for a while, so I was excited to learn that it'd be the first item on my reading list for my apprenticeship at 8th Light. I actually finished the book before my first day.</p>

<img src="http://portfolio.bgraphicstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thinking-with-type1.jpg" class="rightwrap">

<p>This book is an excellent resource; akin to how we'd use a dictionary to refer to words just within our grasp, but the true meaning escapes us. Thinking With Type delves into the deeper elements of typography, even past the letters, down into the most minute details like serifs, bowls, ascender and descender. The way Ellen Lupton describes type in the most sensual ways is really what gets me.</p>

<blockquote>"A well-designed comma carries the essence of the typeface down to its delicious details. Helvetica's comma is a chunky square mounted to a jaunty curve, while Bodoni's is a voluptuous, thin-stemmed orb."  -  Ellen Lupton, <em>Thinking With Type</em></blockquote>

<p>The book also covers numerous other type-related topics from kerning to utilizing the golden mean in creating a modular scale. <strong>Thinking With Type</strong> is an incredibly useful resource, and even has <a href="www.thinkingwithtype.com">a website</a> briefly covering all of the topics.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/myfirstweek.html">My First Week</a></h2>
      <h4>February 01, 2013</h4>
    <p>It was really a stroke of luck for me to find out about this opportunity, and I'm so thankful I did. I can already safely say that I have never liked a job more, or worked with people who are so smart, who I can relate to as much as I am. People who I can talk to about anything I care about, and they just <em>get it</em>.</p>
<p>My first week here has just been getting handed books, given projects, and learning about the team and the way the company works. It's true--you do learn a lot, and quickly. This week, I used Github and got super frustrated. My first project was diving head-first into things I am not comfortable with in the least. By the end of the week, I was told I'd be working on client work. Yeah, fast. I love it!</p>
<p>My task for the next two weeks was to <strong>create a blog</strong> to post my book reviews and my projects for reference and for others to see. I am told this blog will morph and change much during my apprenticeship, so I am starting with something very basic--just a one-column design with some watercolor elements that I will vectorize in Illustrator to make them transparent .pngs. I wanted something to show off my style but something that I'd be able to evolve over time.</p>
<p>The next book on my reading list is <strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong> by Donald Norman, so I will be posting a little entry about that soon.
