    <h3><a href="/chicagodeux.html">Chicago Deux</a></h3>
    	<h4>August 02, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Last week, I was in Chicago! My apprenticeship was extended for another two months and my mentor changed to Stephanie, so I went up to get acquainted with her and to be in their office environment a little more.  Adam had his challenges and it was really emotional for all of us--we all got a little teary eyed during standup. I am so proud of him and eager to get to that point in my apprenticeship as well.</p>
<p>Pair programming has gotten a lot of criticism, claiming that there are "high costs and negative value," but I find it to be an enriching, productive, and engaging experience. It keeps teams tight and encourages the feeling of group ownership. I paired with Stephanie while I was in Chicago and actually helped to solve problems and learned Objective-C along the way. Both of these things could not have been accomplished without this experience.</p>
<p>Being in the Chicago office is a really positive experience and is making me feel like I want to move to be up there full-time. I love the noise of the city and how the volume turns down just slightly at night. I love the twinkling lights of the cityscape, the fat pigeons cuddling on the sidewalks. I miss how busy everyone looks and how absorbed in their own world they are. I love how, in the office, there is always someone right there to help; someone right there to learn from. I love the cooperative energy, the enthusiasm, the pride. I love it there and am looking forward to the next time I get to go.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/united.html">United Airlines Redesign</a></h3>
    	<h4>July 17, 2013</h4>
		    <p><img src="blog/images/united1.png">
<p>Recently, I was tasked with redesigning the United website for a small board of people within 8th Light. The parameters I was given were just to keep all of the links/information, or have a good reason for excluding/moving it. I was told to create an HTML page that had no functionality, and to just "go crazy" to demonstrate my style and what I think would be a good user experience. So, it was definitely fun.</p>
<p>The United website is stale and confusing.  There are too many columns and tabs placed arbitratily throughout the page, which is also riddled with advertisements with their services.</p>
<p>The goal I'd set for myself in this redesign was to design the page as an ode to the earlier days of air travel, where it was fun, easy, and luxurious. My first thought was of the Pan Am advertisements in old magazines which either made use of large pictures or illustrations of exotic destinations or used imagery of beautiful, well-dressed people lounging on a plane.  I wanted to bring back the element of intrigue, comfort, and extravagance to the proposed website since air travel these days seems more a burden than a pleasure.</p>
<img src="blog/images/panam.png">
<p>Since lots of the options on the original United website could be done without, I opted to simplify the layout quite a bit. I made the navigation simpler, include big images of travel destinations that would make the user feel excited or calm, and used more casual phrasing and simple questions. The goal here was for the advertising to be more loyalty- or trust-based as opposed to feeling forced or gimmicky.</p>
<img src="blog/images/united2.png"><br><br>
<img src="blog/images/united3.png"><br><br>
<img src="blog/images/united4.png"><br><br>
<p>All in all it was a really fun project to work on, and definitely presented its challenges.  I learned a lot, like how to create responsive tabs (which I'd never actually had to do before) and worked with some Javascript (the images parallax when scrolling.)</p>  
<p>Upon completion of the project, I had an IPM with a small review board that included some craftsmen at 8th Light. I think the IPM went really smoothly.  Everyone offered great critiques and input which was really helpful and I think I handled all of the information really well.</p>
<p>Here's to more awesomeness like this in the future!</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/decodingdesign.html">Decoding Design</a></h3>
    	<h4>July 02, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>Decoding Design: Understanding and Using Symbols in Visual Communication</em> turned out to be a really great book. At first, I delayed reading it because the artwork inside seemed outdated, almost textbook-like in nature. Contrary to my first thought, the book is not outdated but covers principles that are firmly rooted in art, mathematics & science and thus, are timeless.</p>
<p>This book has really inspired me to look closer into the reasons why things as subtle and seemingly irrelevant as numbers trigger such an emotional reaction.  I am highlighting the meanings behind, and the imporance of, the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5 (which, coincidentally, are the first numbers of the Fibonacci sequence).  These are the numbers that I think are the most important in design, especially when grouping elements.</p>
<p><strong>One:</strong> The number one represents an individual item, but also the "whole"; everythingness. It represents our beginning (whatever you choose to believe is the beginning, whether it is the first amoebic life on this earth, a specific creator, being, or diety, the beginning of the universe, etc). It is important to remember that "in order to perceive "one", a field of nothingness is necessary." Therefore, ONE single item that you'd like to stand out needs to be displayed amongst things that have a similar contrast to the background, fonts that are a lighter weight, or just stark nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>Two:</strong> Two is a very symbolic number. It is the origin of lots of religious symbols in particular.  The yin-yang is based on two--showing opposites that are interdependent. Two is best used when trying to demonstrate high tension in design, or strong partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Three:</strong> Three is probably the most important number in design because it's roots are biological in nature--three is a very pleasing number to group elements in because it signifies completion.  Everything has a beginning, middle, and an end. The color we see is based on three--light wavelengths are based on three components and the ways they reflect or blend. In math, three is the first number to represent a plane or surface (one is just a point, two is a line). It also signifies balance - </p>
<p><strong>Five:</strong> Five is the number of the human element.  It is relateable, foundational, and represents quintessence or the "fifth element". To be used in navigation most effectively.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/orderingdisorder.html">Ordering Disorder: Grid Principles for Web Design</a></h3>
    	<h4>July 01, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>Ordering Disorder</em> by Khoi Vinh is similar to a lot of the other design books I've read during my apprenticeship. Most of its content relates to the grid structure and designing a website.  It also gives a list of steps that can be followed when executing a design.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on research and sketching. Vinh maintains that most of a designer's time should be spent in the research and sketching/planning process as opposed to in the coding process.  For me personally, this is really sound advice--I tend to start hacking away at code, changing things here and there to reflect what I'm seeing in my mind's eye.  I have never really felt any need to step up my planning game until working for 8th Light.  Now, I see its importance.</p>
<p>Good design is measured by how well it responds to the original problem, not how pretty it is, or how the color flows, or how intuitive the UX may be (though, those things may be solutions to an overall problem). This is why so much time should be spent in thoughtful study & brainstorming how to create a solution to a company's problem.  This is also where restraints should be considered, including technical, business, and content/editorial restraints.</p>
<p>Vinh also indicates that sketching is super important; not just in the beginning of your project, but throughout, as an easy/cheap way to brainstorm and test solutions.  Making Illustrator mockups at this point just won't cut it--he says to stick to pencil and paper for your first iterations, and then switch to more detailed sketches and mockups later on in the process. </p>
<p>The rest of the book beyond the Process section is all about Execution.  Here, you are taken step-by-step through the design of the Designery.us project, which helps the reader understand the practical application of what was only just touched on in earlier chapters.</p>
<p>Though similar to a lot of other books I've utilized in my apprenticeship, this book deserves a slot in my toolbox.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/scna.html">Software Craftsmanship North America Website Redesign</a></h3>
    	<h4>June 25, 2013</h4>
		    <p><img src="/blog/images/scna2012.png">
<p><a href="http://adamkaplandesign.com">Adam Kaplan</a> (the other design apprentice) and I gave the SCNA website a little facelift.  The website was originally done by <a href="http://nickmeccia.tumblr.com">Nick Meccia</a>  did <a href="http://scna2012.softwarecraftsmanship.com">the website</a> from last year.  It was super great, but we were asked to update it and change it to reflect current web trends and new web standards/practices. So, we broke the site up into sections to put emphasis on both our own creative potential, on the speakers, and on the attendees!</p>
<a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.com"><img src="/blog/images/scna2013.png"></a>
<p>The page is written in Hiccup, which is a templating language for Clojure.  Adam took over most of the structural components and transferred the existing information over from the SCNA 2012 site, put up the new speakers, bios, schedule, and venue information.  I did what I do best and created some fun icons/badges for the front page, and paired with Adam to organize the contents and get the forms up an running.  It was a great experience in teamwork and remote pair programming as well. Obviously, it's not the ideal situation to be in and we probably would have gotten it completed in a shorter time if we were in the same office, but it worked out all the same and our client left happy, which is what matters most.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/passionateprogrammer.html">The Passionate Programmer</a></h3>
    	<h4>June 23, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</em> is a book whose chapters are written as "tips", giving it a more casual, friendlier feel than many guides to a programming career.  It is meant to be an answer or even rebuttal to <em>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</em>, a book talking about becoming a programmer or advancing in your programming career "by coincidence". The author of the book is also a musician, creating some interesting parallels between that and programming.</p>
<p>Like most of the "career advice" books I've been reading through my apprenticeship, this one offers frank but humerous advice like "Love it or Leave it," and "Don't Listen to Your Parents," ideas suggesting picking risk over security and pursuing only what you love the most, and not settling for less. These points, among others, are what really stood out to me.</p>
<p><strong>Coding Don't Cut it Anymore</strong>: Just doing what you do isn't enough. You must strive to become the master of your profession.</p>
<p><strong>Be The Worst</strong>: If you're the worst you're sure to be surrounded by the best, from whom you can learn and vibe off of, thus making your work better and stronger. Emulation is inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Generalist</strong>: Be able to do many things. Don't just "graphic design", don't just "program". Know how to do a little of each. Generalists are rare and precious.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Specialist</strong>: ..but be a specialist in at least a few things. Be a master of these few things and have a deeper, more intimate understanding of them.. but still know how to do other things that are not <em>those</em> things.</p>
<p><strong>Right Now</strong>: Don't give yourself the option to put things off.  Do things <em>right now</em>. A sense of urgency will increase productivity.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/chicago.html">Chicago</a></h3>
    	<h4>June 17, 2013</h4>
		    <p><img src="/blog/images/chicago/nightcity.JPG"><p>Two weeks ago, myself and four coworkers traveled to visit our home office in Chicago. It was my first time experiencing flying after what I will affectionately refer to here as the "Baltimore Flying Fiasco of 2011". Of course, as most people do, I learned it was not that bad and really quite great.  After two and a half hours, we were in a completely different and uniquely beautiful place, so it was all well worth it.</p>
<p>We stayed in a hotel relatively close to work. The first night we got in late--around 10:30 PM--and we still had to fetch water, chapstick, and other small comforts for our hotel rooms. This gave us an opportunity to get a glimpse of the beautiful city all lit up at night.</p>
<p>I awoke in the morning quite early (5:00 am, baby!) because of the time difference, and was greeted by a beautiful sunrise over the skyscrapers. The reflective surfaces of all those immense buildings made it seem like the pink clouds went on forever.  The picture does it no justice, really. It was gorgeous.</p>
<img src="/blog/images/chicago/balcony1.JPG" width="730px">
<p>We saw lots of amazing sights just on our walk into work on the first day. <img src="/blog/images/chicago/city.JPG"><p>Throughout our visit, we got to go to some really really cool places to eat including the French Market which had several different vendors selling all kinds of food.  There was a fresh fruit smoothie place, a korean place (I got bulgogi), French food, fresh fish and meats, organic vegetables, a raw/vegan bar, and sushi! There was no shortage of amazing stuff. Our first night, we went out to enjoy drinks (well, not me) and foie gras (yes, me!) It was delightful. </p>
<p>Seeing how immense the city really is was the most amazing thing to me as a first time Chicago goer.</p>
<p>We worked with new people and at the end, got to go on a company bike ride through town. We got to see Lake Michigan and feel the amazing cool breeze blowing from the northeast that a storm two nights prior brought over.</p>
<img src="blog/images/chicago/bike.JPG" class="big-img">
<p>Most of this post is about the touristy aspect, I know. But we gained a lot of insight and learned so much more about our company in the process.  Meagan and I had so much fun working in the office and being able to just grab someone if we needed a second set of eyes. We did a lot of team building (i.e. going to other people's apartments and cooking an awesome feast!) and pairing in the office as well. Learning about our coworkers and being able to put faces to the names we are always hearing was so awesome, and I can't wait to go back!</p></p>

    	<h4>June 03, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>It's funny to look back on my projects and posts and see the feelings I was going through and the things I was struggling with. They all seem pretty trivial now. I went back and read about semantic HTML and making progress bars with CSS, and laughed aloud at how much better I have gotten, and not just with comptuer-related stuff.</p>
<p>I used to just freeze and procrastinate on things when I didn't know how they worked; fearing I wouldn't be able to get them done, or get them done on time.. fearing I would mess it up or no one would like it. Now, I am much more eager to learn new things and am more open to, and capable of, absorbing this new information. When pairing with folks in my office, my fingers fly across the keys--sometimes, I know exactly which CSS trick to try to get things working again. I am so proud of myself when I can easily come up with a solution for a coworker. It makes me feel more a viable part of our team.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/thisweek.html">This week..</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 31, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Obviously, this week has been a bit of a whirlwind. I haven't had any time to post, really, since we had a three day weekend this past weekend and I really had to hit the ground running to get my stories done for IPM on Wednesday and for today, Friday.</p>
<p>The school registration page is coming along just fine. It's all about adding little by little to refine the design and add new features, so I figure it's pretty close to how real client work will be with 8th Light. I am starting to add some fancy CSS transitions and effects, and am really excited to start plugging some jQuery in.</p>
<img src="/blog/images/tictactoe.png"><p>I am also working on some other projects besides my partnership project. I'll be working on a tic tac toe interface with Chong, and working on a site with Adam for some security talks he will be doing. I also recently found out I'll be redesigning the SCNA website, which is both an honor and a terror! I have tons of ideas, though, so I know I'll make something totally bad ass.</p>
<p>Miami this weekend for a much needed break. ^^ I'll be going on a private feeding tour with a friend of mine from zookeeping school who works in the Zoo Miami aviary. On Sunday, I'll be heading to Fairchild Botannical Gardens where they have a plant show and sale. Hoping to find some cool stuff for the backyard.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/maychalkwall.html">May's Chalk Wall</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 29, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>This is a picture of the chalk wall I did for May. </p>
<img src="/blog/images/maychalkwall.JPG" class="big-img">
<p>As you can see, I have a lot of improving to do.</p>
<p>I don't have a ton of experience with chalk walls so these have been really good practice. My biggest issue with the wall is allowing for enough white space/being able to draw super tiny to deliver a lot of detail while still keeping each element pretty small and allowing breathing room. To remedy this, we went ahead and got chalk markers which should afford a little more precision and will allow me to draw things in better detail, at smaller sizes.</p>
<p> This is something I've been learning with my web-based projects as well; I am making it a point to spend a lot more time in the planning stages instead of just "going for it".. Hopefully that helps. I can tell that I am getting better and learning how to maintain the wall & getting better at detail work. </p>
<p>Another issue that I've been experiencing is the texture of the wall. It is drywall, but seems to have a slight texture to it, either from bad drywall repair or just texturing when the building was built. Either way, the texture makes it really hard to draw straight lines, shade, etc. A bare drywall would work best for a chalk wall, with three to four coats of the paint applied to have a nice, thick, durable surface.</p>
<p>Cleaning and maintaining the wall is a bit of a chore. I assumed it'd be just like when I was in elementary school--the felt erasers that you would clap together and be shrouded by a white chalk cloud. Not the case. With a chalk wall, water is indicated for erasing. Partial erasures are messy and smear, leaving a film that can only be removed by really soaking the wall, which I imagine is not great for the paint. A super large sponge is the best since you can get a lot of water onto the wall at once and immediately run the sponge back over to absorb and take off the chalky residue. Obviously, we don't have a perfect system yet, but we're getting there through trial and error.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/jekyllreadmore.html">Jekyll Read More Functionality</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 22, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Jekyll was completely new to me when I started this apprenticeship, and I find that I still struggle with it sometimes; there are so many possibilities that is met with a startling lack of documentation or resources for people just starting out. Perhaps I can start to get my list of tips and tricks together to make a little more beginner-friendly blog post. But that's later.</p>
<p>So, ever since my <a href="/usertesting.html">user testing</a> project where I first engaged in testing my blog layout with my coworkers, I have been wanting to add a "Read More.." link to the projects page of my blog so that only an image would appear on the "front", and you could have the option of clicking to read more about my experience in making the project. However, the documentation available online is sparse and I really just wanted to be able to figure it out myself. I pushed this to the back burner while I dealt with more high-priority things, but when I saw <a href="http://meaganewaller.github.io">Meagan's</a> new blog layout, I saw she had added "Read more.." links to hers! </p>
<p>So, the way she did it was by replacing <code> {{ post.content }}</code> with <code>  {{ post.excerpt }} </code>. This was supposed to tell Jekyll to create an excerpt from the available text. Of course, abiding by Murphy's Law, this method did not work for me, so I had to hop on the dreaded Google and do some more research.</p>
<p>I did find some more helpful articles, <a href="http://metaclaws.com/2012/03/03/jekyll_post_excerpts_plugin_and_also_without_a_plugin_for_use_on_github_pages/">one of which</a> really helped to explain this to me in a way I could understand.  It was important to find something that I could really understand and be able to implement without it being a huge headache for my non-programmery mind. So, this is the solution that worked for me: on my index pages, instead of putting <code> {{ post.content }}</code>, I replaced it with <code>{{ post.content | split: '&#60;!-- more -->' | first }}</code>, making sure to put a link beneath it that'll navigate to the permalink where the user will be able to read the rest of the article.  This lets the index pages split your articles wherever the <code>&#60;!-- more --></code> comment appears.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/balanceii.html">Balance II</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 21, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>It is tremendously hard to find balance at this point of my apprenticeship, in almost every aspect of life. I know when I first started, I was having trouble keeping up with housework, keeping up with my relationships, having "me" time, and balancing client work. Obviously, this is to be expected when starting a new position that demands much more from you than any other position has. Balance at the workplace even tends to be a struggle, because of the focus on estimation.</p>
<p>Estimation is a huge thing at 8th Light. We use Artisan, an internal tool that allows us to calculate how much time we think a project will take in "points". There are two points in a day--so, one point for roughly four hours of work. Being as close to your estimate as possible is the goal--but with my partnership project, I have been off every time. Which sucks--if you miss one story in an iteration, you can't complete the iteration. You can't bill the client. And the company doesn't make money.</p>
<p>Another aspect that I find both familiar and intimidating is working on the design of several projects at once. I am used to doing this to a certain extent because of the work I've done in the past--I'd typically work on anywhere from 3-5 projects at once. Unfortunately, I have to admit that juggling several tasks at once is not my strong suit--I always end up wanting to play favorites and pay more attention to one or the other, and it leaves me feeling like I need to play catchup on the other less-loved tasks.</p>
<p>So, for now, I know of a couple things I have to do to make my estimates more accurate: I have to use visualization to figure out how much time something will realistically take me, and I have to break bigger parts into several smaller stories. This is the only way I will keep from feeling completely overwhelmed, and will be able to feel more success rather than failure, helping me out in the emotional department as well.</p>
<p>I'll also obviously need to start keeping a book or organized post-it notes section on my desk to be able to partition time during the day to devote to the different projects I have on my plate. This shouldn't be too hard; I used to subscribe to the post-it method and found it rather helpful. I know a lot of people at work use the pomodoro technique, but I'm not sure I'm disciplined enough to actually put it to use.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is something I need to work on, and will only get better at with practice.</p>

    <h3><a href="/wireframing.html">Wireframing</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 10, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>I am approaching the home stretch of my apprenticeship, which is really exciting.  For the rest of my apprenticeship, I will be doing mock client projects and working on internal applications that we use at 8th Light.  Since I was doing freelance work before coming to 8th Light (and still work on some select projects), I do have quite a bit of client experience, and consider it to be one of my strengths. Making someone's dreams and ideas come to fruition is exhilirating for me, even with the more "difficult" clients that I've had.</p><img src="/blog/images/wireframesketch.JPG" width="400px" height="auto">
<p>My first client simulation project is to produce a page that a parent can use to begin registering their child in elementary school. The site should allow the parent to input some personal information, and the informaion necessary for their child to be registered in school.  The site should also allow this information to be saved on a database for editing later.</p>
<p>I am really excited to get started on this project.  Most school and government websites are antiquated, nonresponsive, and nondescript. I am looking forward to making something modern and fresh with some personality, but that is also straightforward and simple to use for people who aren't super experienced with computing.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/catering.html">8th Light University: Catering</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 09, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Our main office is located in Downtown Chicago Illinois: a hotbed of culture and great food and personality and tradition.  Innovation runs rampant and population dense in the city's center.  Finding unique, fun food for 8th Light Universities would be great with so many diverse options.</p>

<p>North Tampa is a hard place to find good, unique food. It is a prime example of suburban sprawl--almost everything is a chain restaurant, and at least a 10 minute drive. It is even harder to find places that are willing to cater or deliver pretty large quantities of food. So, I was presented with a challenge.</p>

<p>For our 8th Light Universities, we are typically forced to order bland, predictable, and uninspired food. Jimmy John's and Jason's Deli are some of our go-to places. But there are some problems with this.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>These are chain restaurants.</p></li>
	<li><p>Offer the same kind of food--a small variety of 4-5 sandwiches.</p></li>
	<li><p>Questionable/unknown quality.</p></li>
	<li><p>No evidence of "craftsmanship".</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The way I proposed to change this is to stick with our actual budget (far more than what we were spending), and to use only local places. It was important to find places where we could be sure the food is good quality (we'd been there before, or have even had multiple good experiences), and that also exemplify <em>good</em> craftsmanship. </p>

<p>So, I procured a small collection of about ten or so restaurants to cycle through and try.  They are all local, non-chain establishments, all places I've been multiple times and really enjoyed, and things that I know everyone really likes. I also found a few food trucks that I think we could get to come out and cater for us! I am really excited to share my selections, and hope that it inspires more attendance to our 8th Light Universities!</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/hierarchy.html">Hierarchy</a></h3>
    	<h4>May 07, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Hierarchy is something I have been seeming to struggle with through the duration of my apprenticeship. When Nick was in town a couple of weeks ago, we had a brief discussion about the importance of hierarchy, and how I can establish good hierarchy early on--in the planning stages of my projects. I did take his words to heart, but I am not sure that I am "getting it" just yet.</p>
<p>Art is subjective, but design is not. Every set of eyes is pleased by lines of text, images, or glyphs, represented using spacing and sizes determined by (sometimes) complex mathematical equation and formuli. Design is why we can like how something looks, but we're not sure why. Well, chances are, it has something to do with size and space.</p>
<p>Canadian poet and typographer Robert Bringhurst said, "Big type, even huge type, can be beautiful and useful.  But poise is usually far more important than size--and poise consists primarily of emptiness." It is hard to form an argument against that statement, especially seeing so many websites nowadays that make use of generous whitespace. We cannot put a finger on why we like that paragraph floating around in space so much, but we do.</p>
<p>Anyway, I planned for about a day and a half for the project I am working on now. It is crucial for this project to be spaced correctly and beautifully, as it is a project dealing with web type. More specifically, the art of web type. Using hierarchical rules and perfect poise is of utmost importance, and something I have thought through very carefully. Though I do not strive for perfection, I at least hope for some improvement as a result of my hard work.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/usertesting.html">User Testing</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 26, 2013</h4>
		    <p><img src="/blog/images/usertesting.JPG"><p>Last week, I read the book <em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> by Steve Krug.  My project was then to take something that I've made and conduct a little study with some of my coworkers to see how its usability might be improved.  I decided just to use my blog since it is the gateway to all of my other projects. </p>
<p>I created a questionnaire based on my readings from last week. Here are examples of some of the questions that I used.</p>
<pre>
<p>1. What is the first thing you see on the page?
<p>2. Can you tell the difference between blog/project section? How?
<p>3. Can you quickly differentiate the different parts of the blog/posts (title, date, post content, header, etc)?
<p>4. How does the color scheme make you feel?
<p>5. Is the content easy to read?
<p>6. How would you get to my most recent project?
</pre>
<p>I quickly found out from this project that my blog felt really clumsy to everyone. I have a lot of content as well, so a pretty common comment was "I just feel lost on the page if I scroll down any." Totally valid point! Even though everyone I queried were programmers, they clued me in to things that I didn't realize before.</p>
<p>Armed with tons of notes taken on my little survey, I started to make minor changes in color and in font. Like <em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> suggests, I made little tweaks all the while checking with my participants instead of making a major overhaul which would have taken way more time than necessary. I ended up making the header area much smaller and in fixed position so that you'd never feel "lost"---you'd always know what page you're on. I then presented it again to one of my test participants. I found that, yes, usability was much better, but there were still some things that arose even after the changes I'd made.</p>
<p>I went back and tweaked a few more elements. I added a small downward-pointing triangle to the top navigation bar to rest under the section of the page you were on, so you'd know what you were looking at. Before, I had just highlighted either "blog page" or "project page," which wasn't enough indication. I changed the font of my name to give a little more variety.  I also changed the color scheme on the projects page and removed the buttons; another common comment was that the colors clashed and were kind of an eyesore.</p>
<center><img src="images/newshot.png"></center>
<p>I presented the final product to everyone and noticed a marked improvement on how they responded to my blog page. They were much quicker navigating it and all commented on how much they liked the top navigation bar.  The change in layout for mobile devices was also something that everyone really liked as well.</p></p>

    	<h4>April 23, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Some say that excellent work comes from passion, and some say excellent work comes as a result of great skill. Whatever "house" you belong to, it is a given that good work comes from dedication and preserverence, confidence and determination. </p>
<p>During last week when Nick was in town, we had a discussion about his apprenticeship, specifically the week of his challenges. What he said to me was very profound: scary, yet comforting. He told me his challenges week was one of the most stressful and trying weeks, that he'd tried his hardest, and was convinced that he was just not good enough. Yet, he was okay with that fact. He knew that his hardest was the best he could do, and with that fact, he was completely content and at peace. He did not stress, he did not fret. And he was offered a position.</p>
<p>We all want to be an expert in the one thing we put all of our time and effort into. At least, if you are the kind of person I am -- ambitious and curious and hungry to a fault. I think that part of my challenge here at 8th Light is to let go of fear: the fear that I am not good enough, the fear that I will make a fool of myself, the fear that I will fail. I have to bring myself to see that nothing I do here can be considered failure--I am going through a learning and growing process.</p>
<p>Nick also talked to me about one of our company's founders, Micah, who was coincidentally also Nick's mentor when he was an apprentice. Nick told me that Micah expects excellence from everyone -- not perfection or intellegence or anything really mesurable -- but excellence, the marriage of qualities mentioned above: dedication, preserverence, confidence and determination.  Things that you may not be born with, but things that you make the conscious decision to have or not to have. This is what our leader values most -- people who work hard to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>With this reminder, I am preparing myself to work harder than ever for the final months of my apprenticeship. I hope to write thorough and insightful blog posts, produce projects that "wow" and are representative of my skill, passion, and newfound skills. I strive to excel in professionalism and empathy, and cultivate fruitful partnerships with my coworkers in preparation for my final challenges. When they come, I strive to be ready!</p></p>

    	<h4>April 20, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>It has almost been three months since I started at <a href="http://8thlight.com">8th Light</a>, so just about the halfway mark of my apprenticeship. What better way to commemorate this milestone than to get a visit from one of the design craftsman!? I was so happy to finally be meeting one of the people I talk to every morning during standup.</p>
<p>Nick Meccia is one of our awesome craftsmen, and I think we fit the same mold---we love concentrating on how things look and how they make people feel. It was super fun to be able to sit next to Nick and have him explain some of his critiques to me! It's hard to communicate these things over e-mail so it was great to get hands-on instruction and pairing.</p>
<p>I look forward to going to Chicago to experience the office up there. I am certain it will mean lots of hours of learning and being immersed in the 8th Light culture, which I am too excited about! Plus, that will mean seeing a huge city, literally the biggest I have ever seen, bigger than my hometown of Miami! I am a little intimidated but know it'll be so worth it.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/rocketsurgery.html">Rocket Surgery Made Easy by Steve Krug</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 19, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Usability testing is a method of seeing the way your project is used & interacted with "in the wild," as a way of understanding how to make it easier.  There are both quantitative ("is this release easier than last release?") and qualitative methods (more informal, not trying to prove anything specific) of doing such.</p>

<h5>Why?</h5>
<p>Using test participants other than yourselves or coworkers works because everyone encounters usability issues. These issues are easy to find (though not always obvious to the person creating the app, site, or program), and watching users will make you a smarter, more thoughtful designer. </p>

<h5>When?</h5>
<p>Simply, as soon as possible. Being able to implement helpful feedback in the early days of a project will help avoid costly, sometimes irrepairable problems down the road. It doesn't matter if you have a finished project. It doesn't matter if your app or site has polish.  What matters is that you can find users along the way to show you whether or not you're going in the right direction---and to keep heading in that direction.</p>
<p>If necessary, you can perform the "napkin test" on the fly, where you may draw any one feature of your site or app for another person's inspection. Ask questions like, "What do you think this is supposed to be?", and hopefully the response will be that it looks like a home page, or a checkout screen, or whatever it is you've portrayed.</p>
<p>With testing actual wireframes, you can ask more about process. Give the test participant the wireframe and pose the question, "How would you do x?", or "How do you find y?" Wireframes are ideal for testing the clarity of your navigation and how you've named things.</p>

<h5>Whom?</h5>
<p>Of course, it's obvious that you'll want to test a diverse audience, but there's more to it than that.</p>
<p>You will want individuals with domain knowledge (realtors if you have a real estate app, medical professionals if you have a drug search app or something similar), but you'll also want some participants with none. This offers you an equally valuable outside perspective. You will surely want to include people that reflect your target audience.</p>
<p>This book suggests testing three users for every round of testing. Three seems like a small number, but just three will be able to point out your major problems while keeping cost and hassle down. It's more important to have multiple rounds of testing throughout the creation of your app rather than tons of people and one round of testing.</p>

<h5>How?</h5>
<p>As a <strong>facilitator</strong>, you will not only be the liason between your company/product and the participant, but you will also act as a tour guide and therapist. Your goal is to externalize the participant's thought process, which is no small feat. During this time, you must remain neutral--resist the urge to provide the participant with clues as to how to use the product.</p>
<p>Your debriefing should not last long and should only cover the most important usability issues. Fixes should be made by the next round of testing, and should only be the smallest, simplest change needed to keep the issue from happening. The emphasis should be on <strong>tweaking</strong> the existing design, rather than a complete overhaul.</p>

<h5>Analytics Software vs. Usability Testing</h5>
<p>Software like Google Analytics is very valuable, there's no denying that--it shows you exactly where your users are spending their time on your website. However, nothing is as valuable as being able to see <strong>how the user is getting there</strong>.</p>

<h5>Usability testing in an agile environment</h5>
<p><em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> suggests just one morning out of the month dedicated to usability testing. For those of us who work with short iterations, we don't have to restrict ourselves to mornings, or to in-person usability testing. Though not preferrable and only to be done after doing in-person testing, remote testing can work well: you've a much more diverse population to choose from and the tests can be short, casual, and as informative as they would be in person.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/thecleancoder.html">The Clean Coder</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 14, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>The Clean Coder</em> is yet another book on my reading list by Bob Martin, similar to "Clean Code," which I read last week. However, I liked this one a lot better! I think it was a lot more relateable for a designer since there were no code samples, and all of what I read I could really relate to and take to heart. I am going to write bullet points outlining the things that really meant the most to me from this book. I am excited to take this new knowledge with me into the future of my career!</p>

	<li><p><strong>Professionalism</strong> is of utmost importance and can be very broadly summarized in three points: responsibility/accountability, cultivation of skills and professional development, and creating something that you are proud of showing off to the world--from both the front- and the back-end.</li>
	<li><p>A true <strong>professional</strong> finds four things to be of particular importance: practice, collaboration, mentoring, and humility, in no specific order.</li>
	<li><p>A <strong>professional</strong> is not obligated to <strong>say yes</strong>. However, you must work as hard as possible to be able to say yes. <strong>Teamwork</strong> is imperative when trying to find a solution to a problem.</li>	
	<li><p><strong>Pairing</strong> is one of the best way to get rid of "writer's block".</li>
	<li><p>"<strong>The Zone</strong>" is something to avoid, and is usually nothing more than a manic state wherein there is increased quantity, but not quality.</li>
	<li><p>Selectively attend <strong>meetings</strong>. If the meeting is necessary for the job you are doing now, attend. You are responsible for your own time management. </li>
	<li><p><strong>Iteration Planning Meetings</strong> should be quick and concise; if any one point takes longer than a few minutes to discuss, plan another time to discuss it more in depth. <strong>Demos</strong> should be held 45 minutes before the end-of-day on the last day of iteration.</li>
	<li><p>You only have a certain amount of "<strong>focus mana</strong>" per day. Some days it's more, sometimes it's less. <strong> Focus mana</strong> is a decaying resource, and it's best to use all of it, every day. It is important to know when to <strong>disengage</strong>.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Estimation</strong> is the middle ground between making a commitment (client's view) and guessing (programmer's view). It is not a number--rather, it is a distribution.</li>
	<li><p>There are three parts to making a <strong>commitment</strong>: saying you'll do it, meaning it, and actually doing it. Professionals do not make <strong>commitments</strong> they are not <em>absolutely certain</em> they can keep.</li>
	<li><p><strong>The PERT model</strong> allows you to break down your estimation into three parts: "O" is the <em>optimistic</em> estimate--if everything goes perfectly; "N" is a <em>nominal</em> estimate--the estimate with the greatest chance of success; and "P" is your <em>pessimistic</em> estimate--or if everything goes wrong, the longest it could possibly take for you to finish your project.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Collaboration</strong> is important. Team ownership of code gives everyone more of a feeling of camraderie and a sense of responsibility for upkeep, maintenance and improvement.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Teams</strong> are hard to build and establish, and will require some time to "ferment". Well-established teams can then go on to tackle all sorts of projects together, working efficiently. Establishing a successful team should always come before tackling projects.</li>
	<li><p>Only by being directly exposed to real-world scenarios will someone be prepared to deal with them. The <strong>apprenticeship</strong> model doesn't only work with skilled tradesmen like plumbers and electricians. <strong>Apprenticeship</strong> can be more valuable than a university education and will provide you with more-than-adequate skills and experience to enter the workforce, without all of the debt.</li>
	<li><p>You should learn just as much <strong>mentoring</strong> as you do independently learning--through teaching others, one has more understanding of the subject matter and enriches someone else's life at the same time.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Craftsmanship = professionalism</strong>. It is pride, skill, and confidence. It is approaching obstacles or issues with a clear mind, without avoidance. It is accepting responsibility. It is estimating accurately, knowing when to apologize, say no, and say yes.</li></p>

    <h3><a href="/cleancode.html">Clean Code</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 11, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p><em>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</em> by Bob Martin is a book that you can judge by it's cover.</p>
<p>Out of this book, I was only instructed to read a few chapters since, as a designer, not all of them applied to the work that I do.</p>
<p>The book felt a little redundant to me after my reading of <em>Getting Real</em> from a week or so ago. They are, of course, two different books with completely different approaches to the same mindset. <em>Clean Code</em> gives code examples and details more the process of creating and maintaining a beautiful program, while <em>Getting Real</em> provides a general, easy-to-digest outline for agile development.</p>
<p><em>Clean Code</em> is a great book and I got a lot out of my reading that I can implement in my projects and future endeavors. Specifically, I enjoyed reading about naming, formatting, and organizing my code. Though conciseness and efficiency are two of my greatest intentions, this book teaches that using longer, more descriptive names is best.</p>
<p>The book's emphasis on clutter and avoiding duplication was also something I fouund particularly useful, especially since I am a minimalist in most things--posessions, home decor, etc.  Especially with HTML and CSS, this is terribly useful.  Using shorthand is one great way to reduce clutter.  Using already-declared HTML5 tags instead of making endless divs to accomplish the same thing is very helpful.  In your CSS, you'll want to be as descriptive as possible in naming your classes so that if someone else has to work in that same document, they will know which element is which.  Establishing a base class for several elements that share different styles also helps to keep the document concise, organized, and straightforward.</p>
<p>So, while it may not outwardly seem like a great book for designers and programmers both, the important thing is to pay attention to the general concepts which can be applied anywhere within the software-sphere.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/designersvsdevelopers.html">Designers vs. Developers</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 08, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Some things never change, even over time. The resilience of cockroaches. The shape of bread (for the most part). The fact that razors still haven't adapted to the shin bone or knee. The fact that, somehow, everyone forgets to RSVP to everything.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like these other things that have stood the test of time, in this industry we will always have some beef between "designers" and "programmers". Even in more modern times where the phrase "web developer" has been coined and niche carved, there still exists some polarity and as such, animosity. So, what's the big deal?</p>
<strong>Myth: Being a Designer is Easy/Designers are Dumb</strong>
<p>This is not only degrading but, more importantly, very untrue. You know that quote by Einstein that has been completely overused (the one probably not even said by Einstein anyway)? "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Well, here, that holds a lot of truth. Confession time: I have never been great at math. Really, I hate it. Whenever I see numbers, I freeze up. It's not because I'm a woman, or because I'm dumb--it's just because I don't think that way. And, in a similar vein, logic and equations and parentheses freak me out. This is why I would not make a great programmer. </p>
<p>But consider what I <em>am</em> capable of and what I <em>am</em> good at doing--I am good at helping programmers develop something that a client will be pleased to see. I am good at thinking like a consumer and making things less frustrating for consumers to use. I can't tell you how many times I've heard programmers say something along the lines of, "I know it looks bad, but I can't tell you why." Well, <em>I</em> can tell you why, and I can work with you to find a great solution that won't break anything.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate my intellegence.  Instead, appreciate how I can help you deliver something that will be well-received by someone who doesn't understand all the back-end stuff you spent weeks doing, so that all your hard work doesn't go to waste.</p>
<strong>But, your books are smaller..</strong>
<p>Sorry about that. It's because they're filled with concepts and ideas rather than formulae and syntax. They require a great deal of creativity and imagination to fully comprehend, and require lots of thought and further processing long after we're done reading. We work every bit as much as you do to be the best at our craft.</p>
<strong>Cooperation and Communication Are Key</strong>
<p>Though we think differently, that doesn't mean we have to work differently or segregate ourselves within the same project.  Cooperation is key: communication, flexibility and adaptability are, and always have been, most valuable. With a programmin', designin' duo, cooperation is certianly not impossible. Pairing is great between designers and developers because changes can be made on-the-fly and things explained that otherwise would take days to get across. Plus, everyone learns something new! Score!</p>
<strong>The Unicorn</strong>
<p>"Designers" sometimes get a bad rap due to their more specialized peers: the kind of designers that live in Photoshop, hardly know how to code (and don't think they should learn), give incomplete information (not providing a style guide, arbitratily choosing colors, sizes, margins, widths..), choose form over function, and take forever to produce anything (waterfall vs agile).</p>
<p>Though "there's always one", the number of professionals that are <em>not</em> like that is steadily growing. Now you have "unicorns", the crossover vehicles/jack-of-all-trades of the web world. These people typically place a high value on both logical/mathematical and spatial/artistic thinking, are up to date on web standards and practices, who are communicative and more open with sharing their knowledge, who work the agile way, who realize the imporance of brand continuity on various platforms/media, and are more quality individuals in general because they tend to place an emphasis on continuing education and personal growth.</p> 
<p>Having people like this around is great since programmers won't need to be bugged to make simple changes: a web developer will be able to navigate something like a <code>hiccup</code> document where there's both hiccup and clojure and will be able to tweak not only design elements, but will also be able to tackle bits of code.  These individuals are true Renaissance (wo)Men.</p>
<strong>You're leaving ______ out..</strong>
<p>Of course, describing two different kinds of people is not entirely possible since there are all "kinds" of people.  The point is that "designers vs. developers" doesn't have to be one of those great historical face-offs. Thinking differently allows problems to surface that otherwise wouldn't have, and working together is a much more efficient way to get things done.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/jekyll.html">Jekyll Woes</a></h3>
    	<h4>April 05, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>For this apprenticeship, I was tasked with setting up my blog using Jekyll and Github Pages.  Though I barely managed and had lots of help, I have been able to both maintain it and make massive changes.  Like anything, with exposure and a "dive in head first" mentality, learning is somewhat easy. Google searches also help.</p>

<p>Lately, I have been issues with my blog. First, the posts weren't showing up in the right "sections". Next, the images stopped working. Then, the layout.html/styles.css files weren't working. What gives? First, know a couple things about the way my blog is set up.</p>

<p>The way my blog works is that I have two blogs within one. Confusing? Sure. But it works.</p>

<pre>
|--_config.yml
|--_includes
|--_layouts
|  |--default.html
|  |--post.html
|--blog
|  |--index.html
|  |--_posts
|  |  |--2012-04-06-hello-world.md
|--projects
|  |--index.html
|  |--_posts
|--index.html
</pre>
<p>Each section should have its own folder, wherein you'll have an index.html, a _posts folder, and perhaps some other folders (although not necessary): css, images, etc. You'll have two different html files in the layouts folder, and you'll direct to them from the yaml front matter included in all of the posts.</p>
<p>Yaml is touchy. I learned this the hard way. My posts were in their respective sections (the _posts folder of each "separate" blog) and I was updating everything just as I should. So, what was the problem?</p>
<p>Punctuation. Punctuation was all the problem. This is something I never would have been able to figure out myself, because I do not think like a programmer. I am not hard wired to question the punctuation in anything, where it's placed, or what it could mean. All I know is that gramatically, it makes sense, and so I'm using it.</p>
<p>At the top of every blog post you'll put in the "_posts" folder, you'll have some Yaml that will tell the post how it will be laid out, where it is going on the page, and what the title and date are.  These are all user-specified.  If there is any punctuation in these, it will mess up.  I had a post in my blog/_posts/ folder whose title contained a colon. That little colon completely derailed my blog.</p>
<strong>So, how did I find the error?</strong>
<p>Run <code>jekyll --no-auto --server</code>, which specifically tells you where your errors may be, the file name/location, and line number. It'll also let you know which character is throwing a wrench into the delicate innerworkings of your site. Pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Erasing the _site directory is another thing that you might want to do as well if you're encountering problems like this. That'll ensure that you're working from a clean slate if you have any corrupt files, and will help to avoid having to make changes to a bunch of files.</p>

    <h3><a href="/gettingreal.html">Getting Real</a></h3>
    	<h4>March 26, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>I just finished up reading <em>Getting Real</em> by <a href="http://37signals.com/"><em>37signals</em></a>. When I was first assigned this reading, I was told I'd have a lot to say about it.</p>
<p>But I don't. Here's why:</p>
<p>8th Light is the first software company I have ever worked for, besides working freelance. Therefore, I am somewhat of a blank slate. Several of my peers have the experience of working in massive companies, companies with management problems, companies that are not run by the principles outlined in this book.</p>
<p>Luckily, because I am such a "blank slate", agile development seems natural to me. As a freelancer, I worked like this without knowing it had a name. It just seems like the easiest way to operate efficiently and get things done. Talk to the customer often, make changes based on evolving needs while sometimes saying "no," and delivering parts of the project once they are ready.</p>
<p><em>Getting Real</em> is a book about more than just software development. It is a book that is accessible, easy to read, and simple to understand, even for people in different professions. </p>
<p>This book illustrates shedding excess and working with small steps rather than large, seemingly unattainable goals. It touches on creativity, and how it seems to flourish the more restrictions there are in place.  It emphasizes that it's okay for things to change during development, and that this change should be welcome. These are things that not only apply to software, but everything in life.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/handcraftedcss.html">Handcrafted CSS</a></h3>
    	<h4>March 15, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>8th Light is all about craftsmanship.  Doing something we are proud of doing & doing it with enthusiasm, passion, and skill. Dan Cederholm, author of <em>Handcrafted CSS</em> (and the creator of <a href="http://dribbble.com">dribbble</a>), is obviously a proponent of this same mindset, making this book an appropriate addition to my reading.  </p>
<p><em>Handcrafted CSS</em> does something important: it allows us to style things the way we want, while giving us tools to assure that these things degrade gracefully when being viewed with a lesser browser. Responsiveness and media queries are something that I have been learning about slowly through this apprenticeship, and they're obviously a consideration---making things that scale gracefully, no matter if it's on a big, small, or obsolete device. </p>
<p>While I like to think that I'd make something akin to a 404 error message for people with Internet Explorer ("Too bad, maybe you should upgrade to something relevant!"), for some clients, that is obviously not an option. In some occupations, it is common for users to still be booting up a Windows 98 computer and running Internet Explorer 6-8. While we may weep at this very idea, we must also accept it and adapt to it by coming up with new ways to display things the way we want.
<blockquote>"The critical distinction between a craftsman and an expert is what happens after a sufficient level of expertise has been achieved.  The expert will do everything she can to remain wedded to a single context, narrowing the scope of her learning, her practice, and her projects.  The craftsman has the courage and himility to set aside her expertise and pick up an unfamiliar technology or learn a new domain." </blockquote></p>

    <h3><a href="/balance.html">Balance</a></h3>
    	<h4>March 01, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>It has become increasingly hard trying to find a balance in my life between different projects and my personal life, though I realize it is something I must do. Learning discipline has been a priority for me in general, and now it's essential that I show I am capable of this balance.</p>
<p>Switching between client work and my apprenticeship projects is probably the hardest thing for me. It's great to be able to work on two drastically different things, but I find it hard to flip the switch in my brain between the two. This week I worked almost exclusively on client work, neglecting my apprenticeship projects.  Next week I will probably work a lot on apprenticeship projects just to catch up.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/cssprogressbars.html">CSS Progress Bars</a></h3>
    	<h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Today, for me, was all about CSS positioning and fun progress bars. Probably sounds tedious and confusing to most, but this is my every day.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a project where I evaluate my skillset coming into the apprenticeship. I wanted to show this through progress bars that had a little bit of drop shadow detail, a little bit of text, and some cool blurred images in the background. I wanted to mimic a really cool layout style that I've seen before, and that my co-apprentice Adam Kaplan executed for his <a href="http://adamkaplandesign.com/position-properties.html" alt="Adam Kaplan Design: Position Properties">positioning project</a>.</p>
<p>I won't elaborate too much because I will have to complete this same project soon--but I had to use a bunch of new CSS that I'd never used before. It was fun to learn and looks great so far.  My goal is to have it complete by Thursday or so. It would be great to be done Wednesday, but.. we'll see.</p></p>

    	<h4>February 14, 2013</h4>
		    <p><a href="/../projects/semanticmenu/index.html"><img src="/projects/semanticmenu/images/screenshot.png"></a>
<p>You can find the original menu <a href="/projects/semanticmenu/refinerymenu.pdf">here</a>. The Refinery is one of our favorite restaurants in Tampa and is well-known for changing their menu up weekly to reflect their fresh farmers' market finds.<p>
<p>My first non-blog-related project for my apprenticeship was to create a semantic HTML version of a restaurant menu.  CSS could be used for simple styles and positioning, but no images could be used. I would use HTML elements to make the code simple, and easy to read and comprehend.</p>
<p>While this project seems simple, it took a lot more thought than I figured it would require. <p>
<p>Teaching myself HTML and CSS was a bit of a trainwreck composed of hacking bits of code together and having it work--but just barely. So I knew that learning to write everything myself from top to bottom would be a real challenge. <p>

    <h3><a href="/thedesignofeverydaythings.html">The Design of Everyday Things</a></h3>
    	<h4>February 08, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Next on my reading list was <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, by Donald Norman. The book was actually first published in the year I was born, but the ideas and principles in the book remain relevant.</p>

<p>As we move through our world, we are met with thousands of choices--most, if not all of which we are unaware. In my morning routine alone, I am met with hundreds of decisions based on the appliances and hardware that I am using. Using a coffee machine, faucets, doors and windows..</p>

<img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5301/5638283158_21bbf92d00_z.jpg" class="leftwrap"><p>Obviously, detailing all the points of this book would be laborious.  Some of the points I found most interesting and helpful for our purposes were centered around making difficult things simple. In software design, we are tasked with putting hundreds of different functions into something that should look streamlined, friendly, while also being intuitive.  We expect people to know or understand how to do certain things, where to look next, how to get back to what they were doing before.. there are so many things to take into consideration when designing things that can essentially become such a huge part of someone's everyday life.</p>

		    <p><p>It was really a stroke of luck for me to find out about this opportunity at 8th Light, and I'm so thankful I did. I can already safely say that I have never liked a job more, or worked with people who are so smart, who I can relate to as much as I am now. People who I can talk to about anything I care about, and they just <em>get it</em>.</p>
<p>My first week here has just been getting handed books, given projects, and am learning about the team and the way the company works. It's true--you do learn a lot, and quickly. This week, I used Github for the first time and got super frustrated. My first project was diving head-first into things I am not comfortable with in the least. By the end of the week, I was told I'd be working on client work. Yeah, fast. I love it!</p></p>

    	<h4>February 02, 2013</h4>
		    <p><p>Typography holds a special place in my heart; its importance is undeniable, yet, it is often overlooked. Pinterest and Tumblr have popularized hand-lettering, helping people realize typography's role in computer- and print-based media.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking With Type</strong> by Ellen Lupton has been on my Amazon wish list for a while, so I was excited to learn that it'd be the first item on my reading list for my apprenticeship at 8th Light. I actually finished the book before my first day.</p>

<p>This book is an excellent resource; akin to how we'd use a dictionary to refer to words just within our grasp, but the true meaning escapes us. Thinking With Type delves into the deeper elements of typography, even past the letters, down into the most minute details like serifs, bowls, ascender and descender. The way Ellen Lupton describes type in the most sensual ways is really what gets me.</p></p>
