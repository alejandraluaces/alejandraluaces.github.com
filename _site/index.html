    <h4>May 10, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p>I am approaching the home stretch of my apprenticeship, which is really exciting.  For the rest of my apprenticeship, I will be doing mock client projects.  Since I was doing freelance work before coming to 8th Light (and still work on some select projects), I do have quite a bit of client experience, and consider it to be one of my strengths. Making someone's dreams and ideas come to fruition is exhilirating for me, even with the more "difficult" clients that I've had.</p></p>

    <h4>May 09, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p>Our main office is located in Downtown Chicago Illinois: a hotbed of culture and great food and personality and tradition.  Innovation runs rampant and population dense in the city's center.  Finding unique, fun food for 8th Light Universities would be great with so many diverse options.</p></p>

    <h4>May 07, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p>Hierarchy is something I have been seeming to struggle with through the duration of my apprenticeship. When Nick was in town a couple of weeks ago, we had a brief discussion about the importance of hierarchy, and how I can establish good hierarchy early on--in the planning stages of my projects. I did take his words to heart, but I am not sure that I am "getting it" just yet.</p></p>

	    <p><p>It has almost been three months since I started at <a href="http://8thlight.com">8th Light</a>, so just about the halfway mark of my apprenticeship. What better way to commemorate this milestone than to get a visit from one of the design craftsman!? I was so happy to finally be meeting one of the people I talk to every morning during standup.</p></p>

    <h4>April 19, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p>Usability testing is a method of seeing the way your project is used & interacted with "in the wild," as a way of understanding how to make it easier.  There are both quantitative ("is this release easier than last release?") and qualitative methods (more informal, not trying to prove anything specific) of doing such.</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/thecleancoder.html">The Clean Coder</a></h3>
    <h4>April 14, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p><em>The Clean Coder</em> is yet another book on my reading list by Bob Martin, similar to "Clean Code," which I read last week. However, I liked this one a lot better! I think it was a lot more relateable for a designer since there were no code samples, and all of what I read I could really relate to and take to heart. I am going to write bullet points outlining the things that really meant the most to me from this book. I am excited to take this new knowledge with me into the future of my career!</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/designersvsdevelopers.html">Designers vs. Developers</a></h3>
    <h4>April 08, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p>Some things never change, even over time. The resilience of cockroaches. The shape of bread (for the most part). The fact that razors still haven't adapted to the shin bone or knee. The fact that, somehow, everyone forgets to RSVP to everything.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like these other things that have stood the test of time, in this industry we will always have some beef between "designers" and "programmers". Even in more modern times where the phrase "web developer" has been coined and niche carved, there still exists some polarity and as such, animosity. So, what's the big deal?</p></p>

    <h3><a href="/jekyll.html">Jekyll Woes</a></h3>
    <h4>April 05, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p>For this apprenticeship, I was tasked with setting up my blog using Jekyll and Github Pages.  Though I barely managed and had lots of help, I have been able to both maintain it and make massive changes.  Like anything, with exposure and a "dive in head first" mentality, learning is somewhat easy. Google searches also help.</p></p>

Dan Cederholm, author of <em>Handcrafted CSS</em>, is obviously a huge proponent of this same mindset, making this book an appropriate addition to my reading.  </p></p>

I can already safely say that I have never liked a job more, or worked with people who are so smart, who I can relate to as much as I am. People who I can talk to about anything I care about, and they just <em>get it</em>.</p></p>
