	  <h2><a href="/thecleancoder.html">The Clean Coder</a></h2>
      <h4>April 14, 2013</h4>
    <p><em>The Clean Coder</em> is yet another book by Bob Martin, similar to the one I read last week. However, I liked this one a lot better! I think it was a lot more relateable for a designer since there were no code samples, and most of the chapters could directly be applied to our work. I will summarize the ideas I liked best through bullet points to make my "sparknotes" as concise and as easily absorbed as possible.</p>

	<li><p><strong>Professionalism</strong> is of utmost importance and can be very broadly summarized in three points: responsibility/accountability, cultivation of skills and professional development, and creating something that you are proud of showing off to the world--from both the front- and the back-end.</li>
	<li><p>A true <strong>professional</strong> finds four things to be of particular importance: practice, collaboration, mentoring, and humility, in no specific order.</li>
	<li><p>A professional is not obligated to <strong>say yes</strong>. However, you must work as hard as possible to be able to say yes. Teamwork is imperative when trying to find a solution to a problem.</li>	
	<li><p><strong>Pairing</strong> is one of the best way to get rid of "writer's block".</li>
	<li><p>"<strong>The Zone</strong>" is something to avoid, and is usually nothing more than a manic state wherein there is increased quantity, but not quality.</li>
	<li><p>Selectively attend <strong>meetings</strong>. <strong>Iteration Planning Meetings</strong> should be quick and concise; if any one point takes longer than a few minutes to discuss, plan another time to discuss it more in depth. <strong>Demos</strong> should be held 45 minutes before the end-of-day on the last day of iteration.</li>
	<li><p>You only have a certain amount of "<strong>focus mana</strong>" per day. Some days it's more, sometimes it's less. <strong> Focus mana</strong> is a decaying resource, and it's best to use all of it, every day. It is important to know when to <strong>disengage</strong>.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Estimation</strong> is the middle ground between making a commitment (client's view) and guessing (programmer's view). It is not a number--rather, it is a distribution.</li>
	<li><p>There are three parts to making a <strong>commitment</strong>: saying you'll do it, meaning it, and actually doing it. Professionals do not make <strong>commitments</strong> they are not <em>absolutely certain</em> they can keep.</li>
	<li><p><strong>The PERT model</strong> allows you to break down your estimation into three parts: "O" is the <em>optimistic</em> estimate--if everything goes perfectly; "N" is a <em>nominal</em> estimate--the estimate with the greatest chance of success; and "P" is your <em>pessimistic</em> estimate--or if everything goes wrong, the longest it could possibly take for you to finish your project.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Collaboration</strong> is important. Team ownership of code gives everyone more of a feeling of camraderie and a sense of responsibility for upkeep, maintenance and improvement.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Teams</strong> are hard to build and establish, and will require some time to "ferment". Well-established teams can then go on to tackle all sorts of projects together, working efficiently. Establishing a team should always come before tackling projects.</li>
	<li><p>Only by being directly exposed to real-world scenarios will someone be prepared to deal with them. The <strong>apprenticeship</strong> model doesn't only work with skilled tradesmen like plumbers and electricians. <strong>Apprenticeship</strong> can be more valuable than a university education and will provide you with more-than-adequate skills and experience to enter the workforce, without all of the debt.</li>
	<li><p>You should learn just as much <strong>mentoring</strong> as you do independently learning--through teaching others, one has more understanding of the subject matter and enriches someone else's life at the same time.</li>
	<li><p><strong>Craftsmanship = professionalism</strong>. It is pride, skill, and confidence. It is approaching obstacles or issues with a clear mind, without avoidance. It is accepting responsibility. It is estimating accurately, knowing when to apologize, say no, and say yes.</li>

	  <h2><a href="/designersvsdevelopers.html">Designers vs. Developers</a></h2>
      <h4>April 08, 2013</h4>
    <p>Some things never change, even over time. The resilience of cockroaches. The shape of bread (for the most part). The fact that razors still haven't adapted to the shin bone or knee. The fact that, somehow, everyone forgets to RSVP to everything.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like these other things that have stood the test of time, in this industry we will always have some beef between "designers" and "programmers". Even in more modern times where the phrase "web developer" has been coined, there still exists some animosity. So, what's the big deal?</p>

<h2>Myth: Being a Designer is Easy/Designers are Dumb</h2>
<p>This is not only degrading but, more importantly, very untrue. You know that quote by Einstein that has been completely overused (the one probably not even said by Einstein anyway)? "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Well, here, that holds a lot of truth. Confession time: I have never been great at math. Really, I hate it. Whenever I see numbers, I freeze up. It's not because I'm a woman, or because I'm dumb--it's just because I don't think that way. And, in a similar vein, logic and equations and parentheses freak me out. This is why I would not make a great programmer. </p>
<p>But consider what I <em>am</em> capable of and what I <em>am</em> good at doing--I am good at helping programmers develop something that a client will be pleased to see. I am good at thinking like a consumer and making things less frustrating for consumers to use. I can't tell you how many times I've heard programmers say something along the lines of, "I know it looks bad, but I can't tell you why." Well, <em>I</em> can tell you why, and I can work with you to find a great solution that won't break anything. Yay!</p>
<p>Do not underestimate my intellegence.  Instead, appreciate how I can help you deliver something that will be received well by someone who doesn't understand all the back-end stuff you spent weeks doing, so that all your hard work doesn't go to waste.</p>

<h2>But, your books are smaller..</h2>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>

<h2>Cooperation and Communication Are Key</h2>
<p>Though we think differently, that doesn't mean we have to work differently or segregate ourselves within the same project.  Cooperation is key: communication, flexibility and adaptability are, and always have been, valuable. With programmin', designin' duo, cooperation is certianly not impossible. Pairing is great between designers and developers because changes can be made on-the-fly and things explained that otherwise would take days to get across.</p>
<h2>The Crossover Model</h2>
<p>Way back when (what, like two years ago?), "designers" got a bad rap from their less-skilled, lazier peers: the kind of designers that created everything in Photoshop, hardly knew how to code (and didn't care to learn), gave incomplete information (not providing a style guide), chose form over function, and took forever to produce anything.</p>
<p>Though there are still "designers" like that, the number of professionals that are <em>not</em> like that is steadily growing. Now you have "web developers," the crossover vehicles/jack-of-all-trades of the web world. These people typically place a high value on both logical and spacial thinking, are up to date on web standards, who are communicative and more open with sharing their knowledge, who realize the imporance of brand continuity on various platforms/media, and are more quality individuals in general because they tend to place an emphasis on continuing education and personal growth. Having people like this around is great since programmers won't need to be bugged to make simple changes: a web developer will be able to navigate something like a <code>hiccup</code> document where there's both hiccup and clojure and will be able to tweak not only design elements, but will also be able to tackle bits of code.  These individuals are true Renaissance (wo)Men.</p>
<h2>You're leaving ______ out..</h2>
<p>Of course, describing two different kinds of people is not entirely possible since there's an exception to the rule.  The point is that "designers vs. developers" doesn't have to be one of those great historical face-offs. Thinking differently allows problems to surface that otherwise wouldn't have, and working together is a much more efficient way to get things done.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/jekyll.html">Jekyll Woes</a></h2>
      <h4>April 05, 2013</h4>
    <p>For this apprenticeship, I was tasked with setting up my blog using Jekyll and Github Pages.  Though I barely managed and had lots of help, I have been able to both maintain it and make massive changes.  Like anything, with exposure and a "dive in head first" mentality, learning is somewhat easy. Google searches also help.</p>

<p>Lately, I have been issues with my blog. First, the posts weren't showing up in the right "sections". Next, the images stopped working. Then, the layout.html/styles.css files weren't working. What gives? First, know a couple things about the way my blog is set up.</p>

<p>The way my blog works is that I have two blogs within one. Confusing? Sure. But it works.</p>

<pre>
|--_config.yml
|--_includes
|--_layouts
|  |--default.html
|  |--post.html
|--blog
|  |--index.html
|  |--_posts
|  |  |--2012-04-06-hello-world.md
|--projects
|  |--index.html
|  |--_posts
|--index.html
</pre>
<p>Each section should have its own folder, wherein you'll have an index.html, a _posts folder, and perhaps some other folders (although not necessary): css, images, etc. You'll have two different html files in the layouts folder, and you'll direct to them from the yaml front matter included in all of the posts.</p>
<p>Yaml is touchy. I learned this the hard way. My posts were in their respective sections (the _posts folder of each "separate" blog) and I was updating everything just as I should. So, what was the problem?</p>
<p>Punctuation. Punctuation was all the problem. This is something I never would have been able to figure out myself, because I do not think like a programmer. I am not hard wired to question the punctuation in anything, where it's placed, or what it could mean. All I know is that gramatically, it makes sense, and so I'm using it.</p>
<p>At the top of every blog post you'll put in the "_posts" folder, you'll have some Yaml that will tell the post how it will be laid out, where it is going on the page, and what the title and date are.  These are all user-specified.  If there is any punctuation in these, it will mess up.  I had a post in my blog/_posts/ folder whose title contained a colon. That little colon completely derailed my blog.</p>
<h2>So, how did I find the error?</h2>
<p>My mentor Justin showed me how to run <code>jekyll --no-auto --server</code>, which specifically tells you where your errors may be, the file name/location, and line number. It'll also let you know which character is throwing a wrench into the delicate innerworkings of your site. Pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Erasing the _site directory is another thing that you might want to do as well if you're encountering problems like this. That'll ensure that you're working from a clean slate if you have any corrupt files, and will help to avoid having to make changes to a bunch of files.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/gettingreal.html">Getting Real</a></h2>
      <h4>March 26, 2013</h4>
    <p>Recently, I finished up reading <em>Getting Real</em> by <a href="http://37signals.com/"><em>37signals</em></a>. When I was first assigned this reading, I was told I'd have a lot to say about it.</p>
<p>But I don't. And here's why.</p>
<p>8th Light is the first software company I have ever worked for. Therefore, I am somewhat of a blank slate. Several of my peers have the experience of working in massive companies, companies with management problems, companies that are not run by the principles outlined in this book.</p>
<p>Luckily, because I am such a "blank slate", agile development seems natural to me. As a freelancer, I worked like this without knowing it had a name. It just seems like the easiest way to operate efficiently and get things done. Talk to the customer often, make changes based on evolving needs while sometimes saying "no," and delivering parts of the project once they are ready.</p>
<p><em>Getting Real</em> is a book about more than just software development. It is a book that is accessible, easy to read, and simple to understand. </p>
<p>This book illustrates shedding excess and working with small steps rather than large, seemingly unattainable goals. It touches on creativity, and how it seems to flourish the more restrictions there are in place.  It emphasizes that it's okay for things to change during development, and that this change should be welcome. These are things that not only apply to software, but everything.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/handcraftedcss.html">Handcrafted CSS</a></h2>
      <h4>March 15, 2013</h4>
    <p>8th Light is all about craftsmanship.  Doing something we are proud of doing & doing it with enthusiasm, passion, and skill. Dan Cederholm, author of <em>Handcrafted CSS</em>, is obviously a huge proponent of this same mindset, making this book an appropriate addition to my reading.  
<p><em>Handcrafted CSS</em> does something important: it allows us to style things the way we want, while giving us tools to assure that these things degrade gracefully when being viewed with a lesser browser. Responsiveness is something that I have been learning about slowly through this apprenticeship, and is definitely a consideration---not only making things that are supported on smaller devices, but also making things that will be supported on older browsers. While I like to think that I'd make something akin to a 404 error message for people with Internet Explorer ("Too bad, maybe you should upgrade to something relevant!"), for some clients, that is obviously not an option. In some occupations, it is common for users to still be booting up a Windows 98 computer and running Internet Explorer 6-8. While we may weep at this very idea, we must also accept it and adapt to it by coming up with new ways to display things the way we want.
<blockquote>"The critical distinction between a craftsman and an expert is what happens after a sufficient level of expertise has been achieved.  The expert will do everything she can to remain wedded to a single context, narrowing the scope of her learning, her practice, and her projects.  The craftsman has the courage and himility to set aside her expertise and pick up an unfamiliar technology or learn a new domain." </blockquote>

	  <h2><a href="/balance.html">Balance</a></h2>
      <h4>March 01, 2013</h4>
    <p>It has become increasingly hard trying to find a balance in my life between different projects and my personal life, though I realize it is something I must do. Learning discipline has been a priority for me in general, and now it's essential that I show I am capable of this balance.
<p>Switching between client work and my apprenticeship projects is probably the hardest thing for me. It's great to be able to work on two drastically different things, but I find it hard to flip the switch in my brain between the two. This week I worked almost exclusively on client work, neglecting my apprenticeship projects.  Next week I will probably work a lot on apprenticeship projects just to catch up.
<p>That being said, I am having fun and learning a lot. Jekyll is a templating language for Clojure that I have been learning. Lots of brackets and parentheses.  But I am finding that it comes easier with practice (and mistakes).

	  <h2><a href="/morecsstweaks.html">More CSS tweaks</a></h2>
      <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
    <p>Lots of tweaks still today.  Lots of what I am doing with my self-evaluation is just making sure things flow well and the colors and fonts look good together. Right now, I am not going to worry about responsiveness because I am just starting to learn about it.</p>
<p> I am also going to be working on an <em>actual</em> client project which is very exciting, but becoming a top priority so I won't be able to do as many projects a week as I had planned.</p>
<p>Today, I also signed up for a couple of Skillshare classes that I think will help my design skills out a little.  I am taking a class on hand-lettering, and one on using pattern, texture, and color in illustrations. I have really been getting into both lately, and am happy to be able to share the resources with the rest of the design team.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/cssprogressbars.html">CSS Progress Bars</a></h2>
      <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
    <p>Today, for me, was all about CSS positioning and fun progress bars.  I am currently working on a project where I evaluate my skillset coming into the apprenticeship. I wanted to show this through progress bars that had a little bit of drop shadow detail, a little bit of text, and some cool blurred images in the background. I wanted to mimic a really cool layout style that I've seen before, and that my co-apprentice Adam Kaplan executed for his <a href="http://adamkaplandesign.com/position-properties.html" alt="Adam Kaplan Design: Position Properties">positioning project</a>.</p>
<p>I won't elaborate too much because I will have to complete this same project soon--but I had to use a bunch of new CSS that I'd never used before. It was fun to learn and looks great so far.  My goal is to have it complete by Thursday or so. It would be great to be done Wednesday, but.. we'll see.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/cleancode.html">CSS Progress Bars</a></h2>
      <h4>February 19, 2013</h4>
    <p><em>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</em> by Bob Martin is a book that you can judge by it's cover.</p>
<p>Out of this book, I was only instructed to read a few chapters since, as a designer, not all of them applied to the work that I do.</p>
<p>The book felt a little redundant to me after my reading of <em>Getting Real</em> from a week or so ago. They are, of course, two different books with completely different approaches to the same mindset. <em>Clean Code</em> gives code examples and details more the process of creating and maintaining a beautiful program, while <em>Getting Real</em> provides a general, easy-to-digest outline for agile development.</p>
<p><em>Clean Code</em> is a great book and I got a lot out of my reading that I can implement in my projects and future endeavors. Specifically, I enjoyed reading about naming, formatting, and organizing my code. Though conciseness and efficiency are two of my greatest intentions, this book teaches that using longer, more descriptive names is best.</p>
<p>The book's emphasis on clutter and avoiding duplication was also something I fouund particularly useful, especially since I am a minimalist in most things--posessions, home decor, etc.  Especially with HTML and CSS, this is terribly useful.  Using shorthand is one great way to reduce clutter.  Using already-declared HTML5 tags instead of making endless divs to accomplish the same thing is very helpful.  In your CSS, you'll want to be as descriptive as possible in naming your classes so that if someone else has to work in that same document, they will know which element is which.  Establishing a base class for several elements that share different styles also helps to keep the document concise, organized, and straightforward.</p>
<p>So, while it may not outwardly seem like a great book for designers and programmers both, the important thing is to pay attention to the general concepts which can be applied anywhere within the software-sphere.</p>

<p>Most of it was spent getting my blog up and doing more reading. Like I mentioned before, I got the chance to begin work on a client project, which was a little intimidating but still very exciting.</p>
<p>A bunch of books came in the mail that were supposed to get here Monday or Tuesday, so I'll be doing that this weekend! So excited; I love designer books since they're usually short, have a ton of pictures, and are always so beautiful.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/thedesignofeverydaythings.html">The Design of Everyday Things</a></h2>
      <h4>February 08, 2013</h4>
    <p>Next on my reading list was <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, by Donald Norman. The book was actually first published in the year I was born, but the ideas and principles in the book remain relevant.</p> 

<p>As we move through our world, we are met with thousands of choices--most, if not all of which we are unaware. In my morning routine alone, I am met with hundreds of decisions based on the appliances and hardware that I am using. Using a coffee machine, faucets, doors and windows..</p>

<img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5301/5638283158_21bbf92d00_z.jpg" class="leftwrap"><p>Obviously, detailing all the points of this book would be laborious.  Some of the points I found most interesting and helpful for our purposes were centered around making difficult things simple. In software design, we are tasked with putting hundreds of different functions into something that should look streamlined, friendly, while also being intuitive.  We expect people to know or understand how to do certain things, where to look next, how to get back to what they were doing before.. there are so many things to take into consideration when designing things that can essentially become such a huge part of someone's everyday life.</p>

<p>A great example of this would be Apple products. Where having one button for every single function on an Apple device would become distracting, clunky, and cluttered, Apple utilizes intuitive gestures like flicking, pinching, spreading, and using multiple fingers for certain commands. It uses one of Don Norman's ideas--using both knowledge from the world and knowledge in the head.</p>

<blockquote>I have argued that people learn better and feel more comfortable when the knowledge required for a task is available externally--either explicit in the world or readily derived through constraints. But knowledge in the world is useful only if there is a natural, easily interpreted relationship between that knowledge and the information it is intended to convey about possible actions and outcomes. - Donald Norman, <em>The Design Of Everyday Things.</em></blockquote> 

<p>Apple's gestures perfectly illustrate this point. The gestures are natural to use because they mimic things we do outside of computing--say, flipping a page in a book or rotating a piece of paper on a flat surface. Gestures that we know well and have done before, sometimes without even realizing it, but things that just seem to make sense when applied in this way.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/myfirstweek.html">My First Week</a></h2>
      <h4>February 03, 2013</h4>
    <p>It was really a stroke of luck for me to find out about this opportunity, and I'm so thankful I did. I can already safely say that I have never liked a job more, or worked with people who are so smart, who I can relate to as much as I am. People who I can talk to about anything I care about, and they just <em>get it</em>.</p>
<p>My first week here has just been getting handed books, given projects, and learning about the team and the way the company works. It's true--you do learn a lot, and quickly. This week, I used Github and got super frustrated. My first project was diving head-first into things I am not comfortable with in the least. By the end of the week, I was told I'd be working on client work. Yeah, fast. I love it!</p>
<p>My task for the next two weeks was to <strong>create a blog</strong> to post my book reviews and my projects for reference and for others to see. I am told this blog will morph and change much during my apprenticeship, so I am starting with something very basic--just a one-column design with some watercolor elements that I will vectorize in Illustrator to make them transparent .pngs. I wanted something to show off my style but something that I'd be able to evolve over time.</p>
<p>The next book on my reading list is <strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong> by Donald Norman, so I will be posting a little entry about that soon.

	  <h2><a href="/thinkingwithtype.html">Thinking With Type</a></h2>
      <h4>February 02, 2013</h4>
    <p>Typography holds a special place in my heart; its importance is undeniable, yet, it is often overlooked. Pinterest and Tumblr have popularized hand-lettering, helping people realize typography's role in computer- and print-based media.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking With Type</strong> by Ellen Lupton has been on my Amazon wish list for a while, so I was excited to learn that it'd be the first item on my reading list for my apprenticeship at 8th Light. I actually finished the book before my first day.</p>

<img src="http://portfolio.bgraphicstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thinking-with-type1.jpg" class="rightwrap">

<p>This book is an excellent resource; akin to how we'd use a dictionary to refer to words just within our grasp, but the true meaning escapes us. Thinking With Type delves into the deeper elements of typography, even past the letters, down into the most minute details like serifs, bowls, ascender and descender. The way Ellen Lupton describes type in the most sensual ways is really what gets me.</p>

<blockquote>"A well-designed comma carries the essence of the typeface down to its delicious details. Helvetica's comma is a chunky square mounted to a jaunty curve, while Bodoni's is a voluptuous, thin-stemmed orb."  -  Ellen Lupton, <em>Thinking With Type</em></blockquote>

<p>The book also covers numerous other type-related topics from kerning to utilizing the golden mean in creating a modular scale. <strong>Thinking With Type</strong> is an incredibly useful resource, and even has <a href="www.thinkingwithtype.com">a website</a> briefly covering all of the topics.</p>
