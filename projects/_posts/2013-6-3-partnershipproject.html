<p>I know I've mentioned a little about the partnership project I've been working on with my mentor, Justin. To debrief again: I was tasked to build a site that a parent could access to be able to register their child. The parent would then be able to pull their information from the database and edit it, if need be.</p><img src="/../projects/school-registration/images/animation.gif" class="smaller">
<p>Since the beginning of this project, the parameters have evolved, as they often do when a client's needs grow and change.  From this initial concept has grown a dashboard page which I am very fond of--employing flat design and my penchant for color, I created a columned layout where hypothetical parents can access their child's information and even add new children conveniently from the same page. I used understated iconography and beautiful, subtle CSS transitions to get the point across.</p><img src="../projects/school-registration/images/screenshot.png" width="100%">
<p>I am excited for the next stages of my project, which may lead me to implementing jQuery transitions and popup screens.</p>
