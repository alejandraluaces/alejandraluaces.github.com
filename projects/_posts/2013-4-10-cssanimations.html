<p>My last reading was <em>Visual Grammar</em> by Christian Leborg. I was made fun of by my co-apprentice: "The books we have to read are four hundred pages and all words! You get to read picture books!" Indeed, this book did have a lot of whitespace, hardly any actual paragraphs, and very sparse words.  I was challenged in a different way--thinking, visualizing, and planning versus writing complex mathematical equations and algorithms. And I'm okay with that.</p>
<p>This project on CSS Animations was by far the hardest for me because, though I was not doing anything too terribly impressive, math in the form of coordinates and speed were added in addition to the usual font selection, positioning, spacing, and color choices I usually make.</p>
<p>I stuck to the red/black/white color scheme of the book for the most part, but added some mint in the footer and the top stripe detail in the very first window.  I also made it a point to try to work with "whitespace" in general, since it is not one of my strong suits.  I like efficiency and thus, try to fit as much as I can into every little area. I wanted to give each window/cell/div/whatever some breathing room so that the viewer could really concentrate on the focal points which were the animations and transitions.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this project is the last window about "weight". <strong>Weight</strong> is a theory that I really enjoy experimenting with because it can really affect the balance of a page and the way it's interpreted by the viewer. I took eight circles, made them all different sizes, and made them shoot up the page while simultaneously shrinking, hover for a bit in suspense, and then drop back down, growing to their original size.  I wanted to illustrate how size and object placement completely change the way something looks. I approached it this way because I wanted to give the illusion of rocks when the circles are at their base location, and then a constellation when hovering around the top (I even made one of the circles a different color, like in Orion's belt).</p>
