<p>So, I originally had this project done on Friday, as was planned.  I felt "eh" about it, and my mentor, Justin, looked at it and pointed out a bunch of things that he disliked. It was clear that I wasn't super passionate and excited about the project, so I took it home to rectify that.</p>
<p>I trimmed everything down quite a bit and focused on making things responsive. I muted the colors significantly so that my blog wasn't in danger of being an eyesore, even on different displays.</p>
<p>Anyway, the project is pretty self-explanitory.  I was asked to asses my current skills and make the progress bars so that they could be edited to reflect how I've grown over the course of the apprenticeship.
<p>I used things I learned both through Handcrafted CSS and Craftsman Stephanie Briones' blog. I implemented figure and figcaption, both of which I'd never used before. Learning semantic tags in HTML5 is awesome and I know it makes my code so much cleaner. I am actually proud to show people what I've done now.</p>
