<img src="images/usertesting.JPG"><p>Last week, I read the book <em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> by Steve Krug.  My project was then to take something that I've made and conduct a little study with some of my coworkers to see how its usability might be improved.  I decided just to use my blog since it is the gateway to all of my other projects. </p>

<p>I created a questionnaire based on my readings from last week. Here are examples of some of the questions that I used.</p>
<pre>
<p>1. What is the first thing you see on the page?
<p>2. Can you tell the difference between blog/project section? How?
<p>3. Can you quickly differentiate the different parts of the blog/posts (title, date, post content, header, etc)?
<p>4. How does the color scheme make you feel?
<p>5. Is the content easy to read?
<p>6. How would you get to my most recent project?
</pre>
<p>I quickly found out from this project that my blog felt really clumsy to everyone. I have a lot of content as well, so a pretty common comment was "I just feel lost on the page if I scroll down any." Totally valid point! Even though everyone I queried were programmers, they clued me in to things that I didn't realize before.</p>
<p>Armed with tons of notes taken on my little survey, I started to make minor changes in color and in font. Like <em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> suggests, I made little tweaks all the while checking with my participants instead of making a major overhaul which would have taken way more time than necessary. I ended up making the header area much smaller and in fixed position so that you'd never feel "lost"---you'd always know what page you're on. I then presented it again to one of my test participants. I found that, yes, usability was much better, but there were still some things that arose even after the changes I'd made.</p>
<p>I went back and tweaked a few more elements. I added a small downward-pointing triangle to the top navigation bar to rest under the section of the page you were on, so you'd know what you were looking at. Before, I had just highlighted either "blog page" or "project page," which wasn't enough indication. I changed the font of my name to give a little more variety.  I also changed the color scheme on the projects page and removed the buttons; another common comment was that the colors clashed and were kind of an eyesore.</p>

<p>I presented the final product to everyone and noticed a marked improvement on how they responded to my blog page. They were much quicker navigating it and all commented on how much they liked the top navigation bar.  The change in layout for mobile devices was also something that everyone really liked as well.</p>
