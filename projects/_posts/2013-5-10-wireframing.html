<p>I am approaching the home stretch of my apprenticeship, which is really exciting.  For the rest of my apprenticeship, I will be doing mock client projects.  Since I was doing freelance work before coming to 8th Light (and still work on some select projects), I do have quite a bit of client experience, and consider it to be one of my strengths. Making someone's dreams and ideas come to fruition is exhilirating for me, even with the more "difficult" clients that I've had.</p><!-- more --><img src="/blog/images/wireframesketch.JPG" width="400px" height="auto">
<p>My first client simulation project is to produce a page that a parent can use to begin registering their child in elementary school. The site should allow the parent to input some personal information, and the informaion necessary for their child to be registered in school.  The site should also allow this information to be saved on a database for editing later.</p>
<p>I am really excited to get started on this project.  Most school and government websites are antiquated, nonresponsive, and nondescript. I am looking forward to making something modern and fresh with some personality, but that is also straightforward and simple to use for people who aren't super experienced with computing.</p>
