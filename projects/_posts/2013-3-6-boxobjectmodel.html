<p>Another project done, another several to go! :)
<p>My objective for this project was to design a concise guide to the CSS Box-Object Model. I found it fun and kind of challenging. I think the thing that is the hardest is taking my newfound knowledge and implementation of semantic HTML and putting it to use instead of using the usual nondescript and number-laden names for things. Giving things more descriptive titles and utilizing new HTML5 tags is definitely something I am learning through doing, and making a habit.
