<p>CSS Positioning is something I have mixed feelings about, as you might be able to tell from my most recent project.  It's a powerful layout tool, allowing elements to interact with one another in ways that can improve the flow of your document.</p>
<p>Positioning, however, can be one of those things that, when done in excess, it makes your CSS into a minefield--it needs constant tweaking and you're always in fear of completely disrupting everything on your site. It's a maintenance nightmare.</p>
<p>So, in my project, I highlighted the best uses for each of the positioning properties and also used them sparingly, more to highlight information and give useful tips.</p>
