title: Semantic HTML Menu
date: February 14, 2013
---

<p>My first non-blog-related project for my apprenticeship was to create a semantic HTML version of a restaurant menu.  CSS could be used for simple styles and positioning, but no images could be used. I would use HTML elements to make the code simple, and easy to read and comprehend.</p>
<p>While this project seems simple, it took a lot more thought than I figured it would require. <p>
<p>Teaching myself HTML and CSS was a bit of a trainwreck composed of hacking bits of code together and having it work--but just barely. So I knew that learning to write everything myself from top to bottom would be a real challenge. <p>
<p>For this project, I read <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/billy-whited/2011/10/17/expressive-html.html"> Expressive HTML</a> by Billy Whited. I basically started by just writing up a simple HTML document, as I normally would. It was funny to go back and see how the way that I write my HTML mimics the way I would hack different pieces of code together to make sites---disjoined and very ungraceful. I quickly learned that I hardly had any deep understanding of the languages I thought I knew.  With the help of my mentor, I was able to make my code more concise and flow a lot better. I feel like I have a more structured and thorough understanding. </p>

<p>You can find the original menu <a href="/projects/semanticmenu/refinerymenu.pdf">here</a>. The Refinery is one of our favorite restaurants in Tampa and is well-known for changing their menu up weekly to reflect their fresh farmers' market finds.<p>
<p>I will end my post with a snippet from Billy's post that really summarized my experience:</p>
<blockquote>Expressive html isn’t fundamentally different from “regular” html. It’s not an abstraction. It’s not a new tool. It doesn’t seek to alter the basic vocabulary of the web’s common language.
<br><br>
In fact, even if you aren’t familiar with the term “Expressive html,” I can guarantee you already know how to make use of it.
<br><br>
Rather, Expressive html is simply a different way of seeing, interpreting and authoring markup. It is:<br><br>
A mindset.<br>
An approach.<br>
A departure.<br>
A mantra.</blockquote>
