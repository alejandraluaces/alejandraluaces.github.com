<p>Recently, I was tasked with redesigning the United website for a small board of people within 8th Light. The parameters I was given were just to keep all of the links/information, or have a good reason for excluding/moving it. I was told to create an HTML page that had no functionality, and to just "go crazy" to demonstrate my style and what I think would be a good user experience. So, it was definitely fun.</p>
<p>The United website is stale and confusing.  There are too many columns and tabs placed arbitratily throughout the page, which is also riddled with advertisements with their services.</p>

<p>Since lots of their options for flights and services on the front page could be done without, I opted to simplify the layout quite a bit. I also wanted to design the page as an ode to the earlier days of air travel, where it was fun, easy, and luxurious. I wanted to make the navigation simpler, include big images of travel destinations that would make the user feel excited or calm. Using more casual phrasing and simple questions was also important, as was phrasing the advertising to be more loyalty- or trust-based as opposed to feeling forced or gimmicky.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great project.  I had an IPM with a small review board that included some craftsmen at 8th Light. I think the IPM went really smoothly.  Everyone offered great critiques and input which was really helpful and I think I handled all of the information really well.</p>
<p>Here's to more awesomeness in the future!</p>
