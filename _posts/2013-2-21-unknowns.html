<p>This week, and for the next upcoming week, I have the opportunity to work on an actual "client project"! I have known about this for quite some time, but was unsure of how to approach it, as the project is laden with language that I am definitely not familiar with.  Clojure and hiccup are the "languages" that the web app is written in, both of which I have never even seen.</p>
<p>I remember when I was still in the interview process with 8th Light, I was asked if I felt like I was adaptable and would feel comfortable just "diving in" and learning new languages on the fly.  Of course, I answered "yes!" confidently, because after all, I taught myself everything I know. This couldn't be much harder than that.</p>
<p>I was scared at first looking at all the files and all of the brackets and curly-braces and parentheses.  I was scared looking at all of the weird syntax and jargon that I couldn't piece together.  But isn't that how life is in general? Once we are met with unknowns, we sometimes freeze. Sometimes, we don't think that we can go on, and start to plan our escape route.</p>
<p>So, this week, I dove in. I am making mistakes and breaking everything. But I am accepting that its part of the learning process and that it's natural. It's really the only way I'm going to get good, is by doing all these things that are so <em>not</em> good. I am really happy to be able to present what I've done on Monday, and am confident that we will make the client happy.</p>
