title: Slowing Down
date: February 20, 2013

<p>For the upcoming weeks, I'll be slowing down a bit since I'm going to be dividing my time between apprenticeship projects and actual client work (!!!). </p>
<p>In all honesty, this week will also probably be a hard one because I am detoxing from caffeine! I have been drinking coffee every day for about the past eight months and now I think I am a bit dependent. They say it's only about 5-7 days of agony, so I look forward to it. </p>
