title: Inline, Block, and Inline-Block Elements
date: March 1, 2013

<p>This week I have been scrambling to play catch up with my apprenticeship since the week prior was dedicated to client work. I completed the <a href="box-model/index.html">box-object model project</a> around the beginning of the week, and completed my most recent project on inline & block elements on early Friday.
<p>Inline, block, and inline-block elements are not that difficult to understand, but pretty difficult to explain. I had a lot of fun exploring different color palettes this week, and discovering new ways to convey this sort of information to an audience. I can feel myself becoming more confident with my skills and being able to apply some things that I have been learning. Take a look at my project here: <a href="/inline-block/index.html">CSS: Inline, Block, and Inline-Block Elements</a>.
<p>Friday we spent hosting our first 8th Light University at the Tampa office.  We had just been streaming Chicago's 8th Light University and inviting guests, but this will be so much more interactive and engaging with a live person talking and demonstrating.  We kicked it off with Cory Foy's talk on Arduino programming. I'd never heard of this little kit before working here, so it was really neat to see how easy it can be to make your own robot that can do all kinds of incredible things. My coworker, Will, told me about someone who programmed the robot to open litter box doors when it sensed cats approaching, close the doors when it sensed cats leaving, and then start the fan blowing to dissipate the smell! Completely awesome. 10 out of 10, would buy.
<p>This week I am going to try balancing client work and apprenticeship work so I don't fall so far behind on either. I should have a couple of book summaries up soon, and a project on CSS positioning.
