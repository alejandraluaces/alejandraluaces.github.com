<p>Typography holds a special place in my heart; its importance is undeniable, yet, it is often overlooked. Pinterest and Tumblr have popularized hand-lettering, helping people realize typography's role in computer- and print-based media.</p>

<p>Thinking With Type by Ellen Lupton has been on my Amazon wish list for a while, so I was excited to learn that it'd be the first item on my reading list for my apprenticeship at 8th Light. I actually finished the book before my first day.</p>

<img src="http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/images/Thinking_with_Type_Letter_1.gif" class="img"><p>Thinking With Type is an excellent resource; akin to how we'd use a dictionary to refer to words just within our grasp, but the true meaning escapes us. Thinking With Type delves into the deeper elements of typography, even past the letters, down into the most minute details like serifs, bowls, ascender and descender. The way Ellen Lupton describes type in the most sensual ways is really what gets me.</p>

<blockquote>"A well-designed comma carries the essence of the typeface down to its delicious details. Helvetica's comma is a chunky square mounted to a jaunty curve, while Bodoni's is a voluptuous, thin-stemmed orb."  -  Ellen Lupton, <em>Thinking With Type</em></blockquote>

<p>The book also covers numerous other type-related topics from things as "simple" as kerning, to utilizing the golden mean in creating a modular grid. Thinking With Type is an incredibly useful resource, and even has <a href="www.thinkingwithtype.com">a website</a> briefly covering all of the topics.</p>
