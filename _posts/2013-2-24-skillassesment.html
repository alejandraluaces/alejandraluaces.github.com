title: Skill Assesment (Finally!)

<p>So, I originally had this project done on Friday, as was planned.  I felt "eh" about it, and my mentor, Justin, looked at it and pointed out a bunch of things that he disliked. It was clear that I wasn't super passionate and excited about the project, so I took it home to rectify that.</p>
<p>With this project, I dealt with a lot of z-index and positioning properties.  I will be doing a project here shortly about those very properties, so it was great practice in preparation for those. I still don't feel like I have a great hang of it and its a process which never ends. But isn't that normal with this industry? Everything is always changing, always evolving, and we are just trying to use these tools to execute our vision.</p>
<p>Anyway, the project is pretty self-explanitory.  I was asked to asses my current skills and make the progress bars so that they could be edited to reflect how I've grown over the course of the apprenticeship. It was also important to me to learn how to use divs vertically on a page, representing different sections of content.  My co-apprentice, Adam, did this for his positioning project and I really loved it.  So, I think I am pretty good at it now! I used some hand-drawn elements and lots of color to match my main blog.
