title: What is Brand Identity?
date: August 19, 2013

<p>This is a question I get all the time. As a freelance brand designer, I often turned down work requests where the client asked for "just a logo". Brand identity itself is often confused with just the design of a logo, when the logo is really the smallest part of a much larger idea.</p><img src="blog/images/brandidentity.png" style="float:right; margin: 1em;">
<p><strong>The logo</strong> is the chief visual component of your brand identity, so it's pretty important. It  must be <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/26/vital-tips-for-effective-logo-design/?utm_source=CMblog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=Designing+a+Brand+Identity">simple, memorable, timeless, versatile, and appropriate</a>. Many small business owners focus on this aspect of their branding without worrying about the bigger picture: they pay a designer they found on a freelancing website (whose reputation they know nothing about) a hundred bucks to hack something together within a week so they can throw it on business cards, letterheads and coffee cups. Often, there is no thought given to the return on their investment for something that seems so arbitrary to someone who doesn't know any better. If branding isn't important, why do companies pay tens of thousands of dollars for it? A logo is where trust and loyalty are cultivated.</p>
<p><strong>Identity</strong> is where we start to get a little more into tangible things. Your materials will be laid out in a style guide or identity system wherein your company's identity will start to take shape; the fonts, colors, variations of your logo should be included.</p>
<p><strong>The brand</strong> is how consumers or users see your company, product, or service, and the emotional response associated with such. Seth Godin's definition is pretty spot-on:
	<blockquote>
		A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another. 
	</blockquote>
<p>Design ≠ Brand. Design helps to establish the brand, but the brand is mostly the culmination of that first impression (design) along with how your company represents itself, and the customer's individual or shared experiences with your product or service.</p>
<p>Say, for instance, you are the owner of a big-box retail store. A customer has a bad experience in your store which was handled poorly by the manager on duty.  As a result, this customer never comes back.  Obviously, the last thing on this person's mind was your branding, but rather, on your <em>brand</em> which involves their emotions, impressions, and personal experiences.</p>
<p><em>So, what is the bottom line? What exactly is brand identity? What am I going to get out of a brand identity specialist?</em></p>
<p><strong>Brand identity</strong> is the front-facing image of your company. It involves all things visual; brochures, business cards, stationery, <strong>logos</strong>. It is the icon on your phone, the favicon in a browser tab, the flooring of your retail location, the couch for your waiting room.  Your brand identity is how many letters you fit on a page, what pictures you include with your marketing collateral, and how many columns your website will have.  It is what first starts to form the way a customer feels about you before they experience what you have to offer. From there, the <strong>brand</strong> is developed by the company: providing a reputable product or service, reliable and pleasant customer service, effective and empathetic marketing, and a unique, personalized experience. It is the rude customer service agent on the telephone, the controversial social/political issues your company takes a stance on, the tag on your merchendise that gave my sister's husband's cousin a paper cut.</p>
