<p><strong>The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</strong> is a book whose chapters are written as "tips", giving it a more casual, friendlier feel than many guides to a programming career.  It is meant to be an answer or even rebuttal to <strong>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</strong>, a book talking about becoming a programmer or advancing in your programming career "by coincidence". The author of the book is also a musician, creating some interesting parallels between that and programming.</p>

<p>Like most of the "career advice" books I've been reading through my apprenticeship, this one offers frank but humerous advice like "Love it or Leave it," and "Don't Listen to Your Parents," ideas suggesting picking risk over security and pursuing only what you love the most, and not settling for less. These points, among others, are what really stood out to me.</p>
<p><strong>Coding Don't Cut it Anymore</strong>: Just doing what you do isn't enough. You must strive to become the master of your profession.</p>
<p><strong>Be The Worst</strong>: If you're the worst you're sure to be surrounded by the best, from whom you can learn and vibe off of, thus making your work better and stronger. Emulation is inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Generalist</strong>: Be able to do many things. Don't just "graphic design", don't just "program". Know how to do a little of each. Generalists are rare and precious.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Specialist</strong>: ..but be a specialist in at least a few things. Be a master of these few things and have a deeper, more intimate understanding of them.. but still know how to do other things that are not <em>those</em> things.</p>
<p><strong>Right Now</strong>: Don't give yourself the option to put things off.  Do things <em>right now</em>. A sense of urgency will increase productivity.</p>
