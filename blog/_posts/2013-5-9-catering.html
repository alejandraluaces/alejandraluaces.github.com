title: 8th Light University | Catering
date: May 9, 2013
---

<p>Our main office is located in Downtown Chicago Illinois: a hotbed of culture and great food and personality and tradition.  Innovation runs rampant and population dense in the city's center.  Finding unique, fun food for 8th Light Universities would be great with so many diverse options.</p><!-- more -->

<p>North Tampa is a hard place to find good, unique food. It is a prime example of suburban sprawl--almost everything is a chain restaurant, and at least a 10 minute drive. It is even harder to find places that are willing to cater or deliver pretty large quantities of food. So, I was presented with a challenge.</p>

<p>For our 8th Light Universities, we are typically forced to order bland, predictable, and uninspired food. Jimmy John's and Jason's Deli are some of our go-to places. But there are some problems with this.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>These are chain restaurants.</p></li>
	<li><p>Offer the same kind of food--a small variety of 4-5 sandwiches.</p></li>
	<li><p>Questionable/unknown quality.</p></li>
	<li><p>No evidence of "craftsmanship".</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The way I proposed to change this is to stick with our actual budget (far more than what we were spending), and to use only local places. It was important to find places where we could be sure the food is good quality (we'd been there before, or have even had multiple good experiences), and that also exemplify <em>good</em> craftsmanship. </p>

<p>So, I procured a small collection of about ten or so restaurants to cycle through and try.  They are all local, non-chain establishments, all places I've been multiple times and really enjoyed, and things that I know everyone really likes. I also found a few food trucks that I think we could get to come out and cater for us! I am really excited to share my selections, and hope that it inspires more attendance to our 8th Light Universities!</p>
