title: "Inspiring Emotion with Hand-Drawn Elements"
date: August 23, 2013
---
<p>As a designer, I love strong, clean lines, grids and structure.  However, organic, hand-drawn styles are something I really enjoy seeing crop up in the wonderful world of web & print design. It's a little niche, but a style I really love working on--most of the branding I've done for myself has been all hand-drawn. Emotive but casual, bringing hand-drawn elements into your app adds some excitement and interest to an otherwise stark design. </p>

<h1>Background Image</h1>
<p>Using illustrations in the background can be either subtle or more pronounced. <a href="http://fleeangrybear.com">Angry Bear</a> design agency uses the background to story-tell; as you scroll down the page, the background continues into treetops, a mountain stream, and finally down a waterfall that plunges into a shaded valley. It's a beautiful design that inspires engagement and sparks interest.</p>

<h1>Navigation Elements</h1>
<p>Using handwritten text and elements for navigation is kind of a double-edged sword; while it may seem like a great idea, it can present huge usability issues (what if someone can't read your handwriting well enough to navigate your site?) and be a little bit redundant, especially if you have other hand-drawn stuff in your header.</p>

<h1>Using Image Trace</h1>
<p>Adobe Illustrator's Image Trace is a really powerful tool that allows you to put your hand-drawn elements in vector format, making them scalable and easily editable. A lot of people default to using Photoshop, but I find that I prefer Illustrator for the more organic elements for it's smoothing capabilities and ease of editing via the pen tool and manipulating anchors and handles while maintaining that hand-drawn feel.</p>
<p>Like anything, Image Trace is best learned by diving right in. Keeping it to default before you begin is probably your best bet. For sketches, be sure to twirl out the "Advanced Options" menu and select "ignore white". </p>
<p>After your object is traced, you'll want to expand it to be able to tweak the colors, move the paths around, add blob brush details, and so on.</p>

<p>Just click "Expand" in the top center, next to your tracing options. Then, be sure to Objectâ†’Ungroup objects until you can't anymore--usually twice (using Shift+Cmd+G).</p>
