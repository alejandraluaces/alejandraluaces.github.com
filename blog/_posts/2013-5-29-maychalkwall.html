<p>This is a picture of the chalk wall I did for May. </p>

<p>As you can see, I have a lot of improving to do.</p>
<p>I don't have a ton of experience with chalk walls so these have been really good practice. My biggest issue with the wall is allowing for enough white space/being able to draw super tiny to deliver a lot of detail while still keeping each element pretty small and allowing breathing room. To remedy this, we went ahead and got chalk markers which should afford a little more precision and will allow me to draw things in better detail, at smaller sizes.</p>
<p> This is something I've been learning with my web-based projects as well; I am making it a point to spend a lot more time in the planning stages instead of just "going for it".. Hopefully that helps. I can tell that I am getting better and learning how to maintain the wall & getting better at detail work. </p>
<p>Another issue that I've been experiencing is the texture of the wall. It is drywall, but seems to have a slight texture to it, either from bad drywall repair or just texturing when the building was built. Either way, the texture makes it really hard to draw straight lines, shade, etc. A bare drywall would work best for a chalk wall, with three to four coats of the paint applied to have a nice, thick, durable surface.</p>
<p>Cleaning and maintaining the wall is a bit of a chore. I assumed it'd be just like when I was in elementary school--the felt erasers that you would clap together and be shrouded by a white chalk cloud. Not the case. With a chalk wall, water is indicated for erasing. Partial erasures are messy and smear, leaving a film that can only be removed by really soaking the wall, which I imagine is not great for the paint. A super large sponge is the best since you can get a lot of water onto the wall at once and immediately run the sponge back over to absorb and take off the chalky residue. Obviously, we don't have a perfect system yet, but we're getting there through trial and error.</p>
