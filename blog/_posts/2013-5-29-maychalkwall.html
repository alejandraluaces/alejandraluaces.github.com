<p>I don't have a ton of experience with chalk walls so these have been really good practice. My biggest issue with the wall is allowing for enough white space/being able to draw super tiny to deliver a lot of detail while still keeping each element pretty small and allowing breathing room. </p>
<p> This is something I've been learning with my web-based projects as well; I am making it a point to spend a lot more time in the planning stages instead of just "going for it".. Hopefully that helps. I can tell that I am getting better and learning how to maintain the wall & getting better at detail work. </p>
