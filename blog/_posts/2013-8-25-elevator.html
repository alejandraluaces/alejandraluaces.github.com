title: "My Elevator Speech"

<p>I'm Alejandra - I am obsessed with design, an avid yogi, and animal lover. I love to travel, cook, and eat.</p>
<p>This is my elevator speech.</p>
<p>I love all things design. I think design encompasses so much more than just pretty pixels on the web. Design makes life easier. Design makes unnatural things seem more natural. Design teaches you to tap, swipe, and twirl. Design introduces you to things you never knew you needed, but are now indispensable. Women's and men's fashion, interior design, architecture, woodwork, print design, fine art, and tattoo design are some of my favorite things to talk about.</p>
<p>Yoga is an essential part of my daily life. I love the feeling it gives me; it affords me an hour every day where I can focus on myself. I have nowhere to be, no one to talk to. I leave yoga feeling ten times better and ready to tackle the rest of the day and approach old obstacles with a refreshed state of mind. Yoga brings me calm, clarity, and an ability to handle intense situations and pressure.</p>
<p>I love animals. I went to college for interdisciplinary zoological sciences or simply: zookeeping. I worked with a myriad of different animals, from Black Swans (<em>Cygnus atratus</em>) and East African Crowned Cranes (<em>Balerica regulorum gibbercept</em>) to Red Ruffed Lemurs (<em>Varecia variegata rubra</em>) and Matschie's Tree Kangaroos (<em>Dendrolagus matschiei</em>). I learned teamwork and group ownership of a valuable collection of wild & exotic animals. I learned true responsbility caring for creatures that depended on me for cleanliness, food, and connection.</p>
<p>I love to travel, cook, and eat. My parents own a cooking school just outside of Boone, North Carolina, and from their passion stemmed my own. While their emphisis is on high-brow, gussied up gourmet, mine is on dirty, hole-in-the-wall joints popular with the locals. When I travel, I love to savor the taste of authenticity; if I'm in Chicago, I want an oniony hot dog. If I'm in New York, I want the perfect thin-crust pizza. In Miami, I need to go to La Carretta to get greasy pork and black beans.</p>
<p>As much as I love to eat, I also love to cook. It's all about delivering comfort and the tastes and smells of home to the people I care about most.</p>
<p>Our marketing director proposed I come up with an "elevator speech" for myself to make it easier to talk to clients and coworkers, and to avoid walking the line between uncomfortable and appropriate conversation when you don't know the other person well. I found it to be a really helpful exercise since I am super honest and know I run the risk of making certain people uncomfortable or a little distant.</p>
