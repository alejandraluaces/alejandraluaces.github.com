<p>There comes a day in every 8th Lighter's apprenticeship when they are finally ready to start their partnering projects and mock IPMs.<!-- more --> I have been working on my project for about 7 points now (2 points per day), and today was my first Iteration Planning Meeting with Justin! I didn't get everything done exactly when I was hoping to, but that's the beauty of learning how to judge how long you'll take on a project.</p><img src="/blog/images/schoolscreenshot.png">
<p>I took lots of notes and am fired up for my next round of changes and improvements! I know I mentioned in my last post that I am working on a school registration website.  I have the basic layout down, now I am just going to be adding some more information to the form.</p>
