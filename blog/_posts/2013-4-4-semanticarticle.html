<p>For this assignment, I was to find a magazine article with different elements and text styles to markup with semantic HTML and CSS styling.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge (if you can call it that) was just tweaking numbers to make sure the proportions matched those of the actual article. It helped being able to see them side by side, and I was able to achieve the styles by using simple borders, some padding, and icon fonts.</p>
