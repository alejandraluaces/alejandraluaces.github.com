title: Time Management & Estimation
date: May 21, 2013

<p>It is tremendously hard to find balance at this point of my apprenticeship, in almost every aspect of life. I know when I first started, I was having trouble keeping up with housework, keeping up with my relationships, having "me" time, and balancing client work. Obviously, this is to be expected when starting a new position that demands much more from you than any other position has. Balance at the workplace even tends to be a struggle, because of the focus on estimation.</p>
<p>Estimation is a huge thing at 8th Light. We use Artisan, an internal tool that allows us to calculate how much time we think a project will take in "points". There are two points in a day--so, one point for roughly four hours of work. Being as close to your estimate as possible is the goal--but with my partnership project, I have been off every time. Which sucks--if you miss one story in an iteration, you can't complete the iteration. You can't bill the client. And the company doesn't make money.</p>
<p>Another aspect that I find both familiar and intimidating is working on the design of several projects at once. I am used to doing this to a certain extent because of the work I've done in the past--I'd typically work on anywhere from 3-5 projects at once. Unfortunately, I have to admit that juggling several tasks at once is not my strong suit--I always end up wanting to play favorites and pay more attention to one or the other, and it leaves me feeling like I need to play catchup on the other less-loved tasks.</p>
<p>So, for now, I know of a couple things I have to do to make my estimates more accurate: I have to use visualization to figure out how much time something will realistically take me, and I have to break bigger parts into several smaller stories. This is the only way I will keep from feeling completely overwhelmed, and will be able to feel more success rather than failure, helping me out in the emotional department as well.</p>
<p>I'll also obviously need to start keeping a book or organized post-it notes section on my desk to be able to partition time during the day to devote to the different projects I have on my plate. This shouldn't be too hard; I used to subscribe to the post-it method and found it rather helpful. I know a lot of people at work use the pomodoro technique, but I'm not sure I'm disciplined enough to actually put it to use.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is something I need to work on, and will only get better at with practice.</p>
