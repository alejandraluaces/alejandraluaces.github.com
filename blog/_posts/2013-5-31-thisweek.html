title: This week.. 
date: May 31, 2013

<p>Obviously, this week has been a bit of a whirlwind. I haven't had any time to post, really, since we had a three day weekend this past weekend and I really had to hit the ground running to get my stories done for IPM on Wednesday and for today, Friday.</p>
<p>The school registration page is coming along just fine. It is really all about the iterative process--delivering a minimum viable product and adding value every day, week, month..</p>
<img src="/blog/images/tictactoe.png"><p>I am also working on projects with other Tampa apprentices. I'll be working on a tic-tac-toe interface with Chong, and working on a site with Adam for some security talks he will be doing. I also recently found out I'll be redesigning the SCNA website, which is both an honor and a terror! I have tons of ideas, though, so I know I'll make something totally bad ass.</p>
<p>Miami this weekend for a much needed break. ^^ I'll be going on a private feeding tour with a friend of mine from zookeeping school who works in the Zoo Miami aviary. On Sunday, I'll be heading to Fairchild Botannical Gardens where they have a plant show and sale. Hoping to find some cool stuff for the backyard.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
