<p><a href="http://adamkaplandesign.com">Adam Kaplan</a> (the other design apprentice) and I gave the SCNA website a little facelift.  The website was originally done by <a href="http://nickmeccia.tumblr.com">Nick Meccia</a>  did <a href="http://scna2012.softwarecraftsmanship.com">the website</a> from last year.  It was super great, but we were asked to update it and change it to reflect current web trends and new web standards/practices. So, we broke the site up into sections to put emphasis on both our own creative potential, on the speakers, and on the attendees!</p>

<p>The page is written in Hiccup, which is a templating language for Clojure.  Adam took over most of the structural components and transferred the existing information over from the SCNA 2012 site, put up the new speakers, bios, schedule, and venue information.  I did what I do best and created some fun icons/badges for the front page, and paired with Adam to organize the contents and get the forms up an running.  It was a great experience in teamwork and remote pair programming as well. Obviously, it's not the ideal situation to be in and we probably would have gotten it completed in a shorter time if we were in the same office, but it worked out all the same and our client left happy, which is what matters most.</p>
