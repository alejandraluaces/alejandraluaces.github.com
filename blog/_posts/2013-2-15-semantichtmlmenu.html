<p>You can find the original menu <a href="/projects/semanticmenu/refinerymenu.pdf">here</a>. The Refinery is one of our favorite restaurants in Tampa and is well-known for changing their menu up weekly to reflect their fresh farmers' market finds.<p>
<p>My first non-blog-related project for my apprenticeship was to create a semantic HTML version of a restaurant menu.  CSS could be used for simple styles and positioning, but no images could be used. Semantic HTML is obviously the goal here, as was bringing me up to speed on new HTML5 tags.</p>

	Expressive html isn’t fundamentally different from “regular” html. It’s not an abstraction. It’s not a new tool. It doesn’t seek to alter the basic vocabulary of the web’s common language.
