<p>Usability testing is a method of seeing the way your project is used & interacted with "in the wild," as a way of understanding how to make it easier.  There are both quantitative ("is this release easier than last release?") and qualitative methods (more informal, not trying to prove anything specific) of doing such.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Using test participants other than yourselves or coworkers works because everyone encounters usability issues. These issues are easy to find (though not always obvious to the person creating the app, site, or program), and watching users will make you a smarter, more thoughtful designer. </p>

<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Simply, as soon as possible. Being able to implement helpful feedback in the early days of a project will help avoid costly, sometimes irrepairable problems down the road. It doesn't matter if you have a finished project. It doesn't matter if your app or site has polish.  What matters is that you can find users along the way to show you whether or not you're going in the right direction---and to keep heading in that direction.</p>
<p>If necessary, you can perform the "napkin test" on the fly, where you may draw any one feature of your site or app for another person's inspection. Ask questions like, "What do you think this is supposed to be?", and hopefully the response will be that it looks like a home page, or a checkout screen, or whatever it is you've portrayed.</p>
<p>With testing actual wireframes, you can ask more about process. Give the test participant the wireframe and pose the question, "How would you do x?", or "How do you find y?" Wireframes are ideal for testing the clarity of your navigation and how you've named things.</p>

<h2>Whom?</h2>
<p>Of course, it's obvious that you'll want to test a diverse audience, but there's more to it than that.</p>
<p>You will want individuals with domain knowledge (realtors if you have a real estate app, medical professionals if you have a drug search app or something similar), but you'll also want some participants with none. This offers you an equally valuable outside perspective. You will surely want to include people that reflect your target audience.</p>
<p>This book suggests testing three users for every round of testing. Three seems like a small number, but just three will be able to point out your major problems while keeping cost and hassle down. It's more important to have multiple rounds of testing throughout the creation of your app rather than tons of people and one round of testing.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>
<p>As a <strong>facilitator</strong>, you will not only be the liason between your company/product and the participant, but you will also act as a tour guide and therapist. Your goal is to externalize the participant's thought process, which is no small feat. During this time, you must remain neutral--resist the urge to provide the participant with clues as to how to use the product.</p>
<p>Your debriefing should not last long and should only cover the most important usability issues. Fixes should be made by the next round of testing, and should only be the smallest, simplest change needed to keep the issue from happening. The emphasis should be on <strong>tweaking</strong> the existing design, rather than a complete overhaul.</p>

<h2>Analytics Software vs. Usability Testing</h2>
<p>Software like Google Analytics is very valuable, there's no denying that--it shows you exactly where your users are spending their time on your website. However, nothing is as valuable as being able to see <strong>how the user is getting there</strong>.</p>

<h2>Usability testing in an agile environment</h2>
<p><em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em> suggests just one morning out of the month dedicated to usability testing. For those of us who work with short iterations, we don't have to restrict ourselves to mornings, or to in-person usability testing. Though not preferrable and only to be done after doing in-person testing, remote testing can work well: you've a much more diverse population to choose from and the tests can be short, casual, and as informative as they would be in person.</p>
