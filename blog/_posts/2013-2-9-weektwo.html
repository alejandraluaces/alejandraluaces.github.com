<p>My second week totally flew by!</p>
<p>Most of it was spent getting my blog up and doing more reading. Like I mentioned before, I got the chance to begin work on a client project, which was a little intimidating but still very exciting.</p>
<p>A bunch of books came in the mail that were supposed to get here Monday or Tuesday, so I'll be doing that this weekend! So excited; I love designer books since they're usually short, have a ton of pictures, and are always so beautiful.</p>
