<p><em>Decoding Design: understanding and using symbols in visual communication</em> turned out to be a really great book. At first, I delayed reading it because the artwork inside seemed outdated, almost textbook-like in nature. Contrary to my first thought, the book is not outdated but covers principles that are firmly rooted in art, mathematics & science and thus, are timeless.</p>

<p>I am scheduled for a lighting talk very soon and made a presentation about number theory in art and design.  This book has really inspired me to look closer into the reasons why things as subtle and seemingly irrelevant as numbers trigger such an emotional reaction.  I am highlighting the meanings behind, and the imporance of, the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5 (which, coincidentally, are the first numbers of the Fibonacci sequence).  These are the numbers that I think are the most important in design, especially when grouping elements.</p>
<p><strong>One:</strong> The number one represents an individual item, but also the "whole"; everythingness. It represents our beginning (whatever you choose to believe is the beginning, whether it is the first amoebic life on this earth, a specific creator, being, or diety, the beginning of the universe, etc). It is important to remember that "in order to perceive "one", a field of nothingness is necessary." Therefore, ONE single item that you'd like to stand out needs to be displayed amongst things that have a similar contrast to the background, fonts that are a lighter weight, or just stark nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>Two:</strong> Two is a very symbolic number. It is the origin of lots of religious symbols in particular.  The yin-yang is based on two--showing opposites that are interdependent. Two is best used when trying to demonstrate high tension in design, or strong partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Three:</strong> Three is probably the most important number in design because it's roots are biological in nature--three is a very pleasing number to group elements in because it signifies completion.  Everything has a beginning, middle, and an end. The color we see is based on three--light wavelengths are based on three components and the ways they reflect or blend. In math, three is the first number to represent a plane or surface (one is just a point, two is a line). It also signifies balance - </p>
<p><strong>Five:</strong> Five is the number of the human element.  It is relateable, foundational, and represents quintessence or the "fifth element". To be used in navigation most effectively.</p>
