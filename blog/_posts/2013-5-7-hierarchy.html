title: Hierarchy
date: May 7, 2013

<p>Hierarchy is something I have been seeming to struggle with through the duration of my apprenticeship. When Nick was in town a couple of weeks ago, we had a brief discussion about the importance of hierarchy, and how I can establish good hierarchy early on--in the planning stages of my projects. I did take his words to heart, but I am not sure that I am "getting it" just yet.</p>
<p>Art is subjective, but design is not. Every set of eyes is pleased by lines of text, images, or glyphs, represented using spacing and sizes determined by (sometimes) complex mathematical equation and formuli. Design is why we can like how something looks, but we're not sure why. Well, chances are, it has something to do with size and space.</p>

		"Big type, even huge type, can be beautiful and useful.  But poise is usually far more important than size, and poise consists primarily of emptiness." Robert Bringhurst, Canadian poet and typographer.

<p>It is hard to form an argument against that statement, especially seeing so many websites nowadays that make use of generous whitespace. We cannot put a finger on why we like that paragraph floating around in space so much, but we do.</p>
<p>Anyway, I planned for about a day and a half for the project I am working on now. It is crucial for this project to be spaced correctly and beautifully, as it is a project dealing with web type. More specifically, the art of web type. Using hierarchical rules and perfect poise is of utmost importance, and something I have thought through very carefully. Though I do not strive for perfection, I at least hope for some improvement as a result of my hard work.</p>
