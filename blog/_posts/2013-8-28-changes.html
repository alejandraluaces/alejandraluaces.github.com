<p>It's been a wonderful eight months, but 8th Light and I have decided to part ways. While I'm somewhat sad, I realize that sometimes the thing that seems the best is not always the perfect fit ("<a href="http://www.rdio.com/artist/The_Blow/album/Paper_Television/track/True_Affection/">Just because it's real don't mean it's gonna work</a>").</p>
<p>At 8th Light, I learned several different things that I'll carry with me to my next perfect job.</p>
<h1>Craftsmanship</h1>
<p>By far the most important thing I learned at 8th Light was how to be a true craftsman. Being the best at what you do isn't taken lightly--8th Light has an amazing reputation in the community as being <em>the</em> place you go if you want to get something done right the first time. So, I was not immune to the excitement and pride that comes along with being inducted into the software craftsmanship community and movement as a result of my employment.</p> 
<p>What does it mean to be a craftsman? I would always struggle with defining it and, as a designer, finding ways to pictorially represent it for different internal and external projects. When I'd ask coworkers and office visitors what they thought, the answers would be very similar. "Blacksmithing!", "Carpentry!", "Making furniture!", "Making jewelry!" All of these things come with a certain expectation: that you execute it with expertise, precision, skill, and pride. Craftsmanship is always seen as something admirable, respectable.</p>
<p>Since working with 8th Light, I have seen that craftsmanship is what I strive for. Not a goal, since a goal implies that you'll "summit" somewhere, or that there's an end in sight, which couldn't be further from the truth. Craftsmanship is also about the desire for knowledge and being comforted by the fact that there is always room for improvement.</p>
<h1>Professionalism</h1>
<p>What does it mean to be a professional in the tech industry? I'm pretty sure we're all still trying to figure this one out, especially with how much variation exists between environments. This is something I struggled with quite a bit during the span of my apprenticeship. I found it hard to maintain perfect professionalism and poise at all times in such a relaxed office environment. I loved my coworkers so much, it was hard to see them as that--coworkers--when I really felt they were more my friends.</p>
<p> Our marketing director taught me all about <a href="/elevator.html">creating an elevator speech</a> for myself and limiting my conversation to five non-controversial things that would engage someone and not make them distant. I learned that what I did and said could have an impact on people around me, whether or not I realized it (or whether or not there was an outward demonstration of discomfort or unease). I have always prided myself on being completely honest and transparent, and that is still a value I hold to. However, I can see the value in being able to rein it in a little in order to get someone to come out of their shell a little.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain, and it's that 8th Light is a leader in the industry when it comes to professionalism.</p>
<h1>Agile/Estimation</h1>
<p>One of the biggest parts of the 8th Light process was agile development and estimating/iterating stories. Agile is much more than breaking down tasks into small pieces, having iteration planning meetings, and being super lean or whatever. Agile is about adding value to the customer's product (and thus, life and well-being) predictably, efficiently, and consistently. It's about being honest about your capabilities and being dependable enough that the customer should be totally confident in your estimations. It is about being flexible and adaptable, welcoming change with open arms as the customer's needs evolve.</p>
<h1>Design</h1>
<p>Of equal importance to all of the previous things, I learned all the technical aspects of my career, and learned them well. Not to toot my own horn, but damn, I have become an awesome software developer this year.</p>
<p>I am a master of writing succinct and semantic HTML (including using templating languages like .hiccup and .erb), and elegant, easy-to-understand CSS (SASS). I don't use frameworks, I make my own--placing importance on coding from the ground-up for maximum cleanliness and ease of use. I suscribe to the mobile-first, responsive/adaptive design mindset, and code for small devices from the very beginning. I am a jedi when it comes to wireframing, implementing striking typographic treatments on a grid system, and creating stunning icons and badges. I can handle working with jQuery and javascript (though they're not my favorite, but I'm learning more every day!), and I'm awesome at using git and VIM for maximum developer/pair happiness! I've worked in Ruby and Clojure apps.</p>
<p>Man, I've accomplished a lot.</p>
<h1>The End</h1>
<p>So, while it's the end of my time with 8th Light (and I'm still a little sad about it), it's only the beginning of my journey following this career path. I am so excited for everything I've learned, and all the things I will learn in the future. I am excited for all the new geniuses I will meet, conferences I will attend, meaning I'll (hopefully) bring to the lives of people who need it, and problems I'll help solve.</p>
