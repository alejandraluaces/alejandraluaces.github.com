<p><em>The Clean Coder</em> is yet another book on my reading list by Bob Martin, similar to "Clean Code," which I read last week. However, I liked this one a lot better! I think it was a lot more relateable for a designer since there were no code samples, and all of what I read I could really relate to and take to heart. I am going to write bullet points outlining the things that really meant the most to me from this book. I am excited to take this new knowledge with me into the future of my career!</p>

	<li><strong>Professionalism</strong> is of utmost importance and can be very broadly summarized in three points: responsibility/accountability, cultivation of skills and professional development, and creating something that you are proud of showing off to the world--from both the front- and the back-end.</li>
	<li>A true <strong>professional</strong> finds four things to be of particular importance: practice, collaboration, mentoring, and humility, in no specific order.</li>
	<li>A <strong>professional</strong> is not obligated to say yes. However, you must work as hard as possible to be able to say yes. Teamwork is imperative when trying to find a solution to a problem.</li>	
	<li><strong>Pairing</strong> is one of the best way to get rid of "writer's block".</li>
	<li>"<strong>The Zone</strong>" is something to avoid, and is usually nothing more than a manic state wherein there is increased quantity, but not quality.</li>
	<li>Selectively attend <strong>meetings</strong>. If the meeting is necessary for the job you are doing now, attend. You are responsible for your own time management. </li>
	<li><strong>Iteration Planning Meetings</strong> should be quick and concise; if any one point takes longer than a few minutes to discuss, plan another time to discuss it more in depth. <strong>Demos</strong> should be held 45 minutes before the end-of-day on the last day of iteration.</li>
	<li>You only have a certain amount of "<strong>focus mana</strong>" per day. Some days it's more, sometimes it's less. Focus mana is a decaying resource, and it's best to use all of it, every day. It is important to know when to disengage.</li>
	<li><strong>Estimation</strong> is the middle ground between making a commitment (client's view) and guessing (programmer's view). It is not a number--rather, it is a distribution.</li>
	<li>There are three parts to making a <strong>commitment</strong>: saying you'll do it, meaning it, and actually doing it. Professionals do not make commitments they are not <em>absolutely certain</em> they can keep.</li>
	<li><strong>The PERT model</strong> allows you to break down your estimation into three parts: "O" is the optimistic estimate--if everything goes perfectly; "N" is a nominal estimate--the estimate with the greatest chance of success; and "P" is your pessimistic estimate--or if everything goes wrong, the longest it could possibly take for you to finish your project.</li>
	<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> is important. Team ownership of code gives everyone more of a feeling of camraderie and a sense of responsibility for upkeep, maintenance and improvement.</li>
	<li><strong>Teams</strong> are hard to build and establish, and will require some time to "ferment". Well-established teams can then go on to tackle all sorts of projects together, working efficiently. Establishing a successful team should always come before tackling projects.</li>
	<li>Only by being directly exposed to real-world scenarios will someone be prepared to deal with them. The <strong>apprenticeship</strong> model doesn't only work with skilled tradesmen like plumbers and electricians. Apprenticeship can be more valuable than a university education and will provide you with more-than-adequate skills and experience to enter the workforce, without all of the debt.</li>
	<li>You should learn just as much <strong>mentoring</strong> as you do independently learning--through teaching others, one has more understanding of the subject matter and enriches someone else's life at the same time.</li>
	<li><strong>Craftsmanship = professionalism</strong>. It is pride, skill, and confidence. It is approaching obstacles or issues with a clear mind, without avoidance. It is accepting responsibility. It is estimating accurately, knowing when to apologize, say no, and say yes.</li>
