<p>Last week, I was in Chicago! My apprenticeship was extended for another two months and my mentor changed to Stephanie, so I went up to get acquainted with her and to be in their office environment a little more.  Adam had his challenges and it was really emotional for all of us--we all got a little teary eyed during standup. I am so proud of him and eager to get to that point in my apprenticeship as well.</p>
<p>Pair programming has gotten a lot of criticism, claiming that there are "high costs and negative value," but I find it to be an enriching, productive, and engaging experience. It keeps teams tight and encourages the feeling of group ownership. I paired with Stephanie while I was in Chicago and actually helped to solve problems and learned Objective-C along the way. Both of these things could not have been accomplished without this experience.</p>
<p>Being in the Chicago office is a really positive experience and is making me feel like I want to move to be up there full-time. I love the noise of the city and how the volume turns down just slightly at night. I love the twinkling lights of the cityscape, the fat pigeons cuddling on the sidewalks. I miss how busy everyone looks and how absorbed in their own world they are. I love how, in the office, there is always someone right there to help; someone right there to learn from. I love the cooperative energy, the enthusiasm, the pride. I love it there and am looking forward to the next time I get to go.</p>
