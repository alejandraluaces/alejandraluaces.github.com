title: Why Pixel Perfection Sucks
date: July 24, 2013
---
<p>There was a time where some designers strived for what became known as "pixel perfection". An elite group of egotistical designers would spend hours pushing icons and text blocks around the screen until they achieve this standard. Literally every pixel is considered.</p>
<p>While pixel perfection has an important place in print design (tangible items that, once printed, will never change again until the next print), its place on the web is limited.</p>

<h1>Time is Money</h1>
<p>And especially so for startups and small businesses.</p>
<p> The iterative process should come naturally with design--the emphasis should be put on delivering something that works. After that, it's like any kind of art; constantly improving and evolving into something better or different dependant on changing needs and desires and requirements. Evolution is natural in design.</p>
<p>The time commitment to attain 'perfection' is far too long to be efficient for a web app. Minute issues are given excessive attention, when those details aren't what will be converting customers, increasing loyaly, or making sales.</p>
<p>A month's progress on the internet is like the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution or traveling to the Moon, but happening over and over again with bigger, smarter, faster technologies. Progress and quick change are inevitable.  HTML5 and CSS3 became web-standard and then the flood gates opened and tons of new tools and frameworks burst forth, like <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> and <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Bourbon and Neat</a> and <a href="http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/">Flat UI</a> and <a href="http://daneden.me/animate/">Animations.css</a> and <a href="http://tridiv.com/">Tridiv</a>, and like always, it it just like an insane shitstorm of new stuff to learn. The point of this lengthy explanation is to say that there will always be new things to learn and new things you'll have to implement, which may or may not be compatible with what you're already doing.. which may or may not be compatible with that "pixel perfect" layout you've just delivered to your client. Would it make you feel good that you spent so much time, in this moment, tweaking a project to current trends and with current tools, just to have the client completely stranded with an obsolete piece of garbage a couple months later?</p>

<h1>..and Money is Value</h1>
<p>Pixel perfection just doesn't add value. Pixel perfection has a place--in print and in personal projects. If you're dealing with clients, your goal should be to give them something that starts to earn them money. Plan out something for them that can evolve and scale gracefully.  Give them value, so they can see the value of hiring you, and your lasting relationship will be profitable for you both.</p>
