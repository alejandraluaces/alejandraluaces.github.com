title: Handcrafted CSS 
date: March 15, 2013

<p>8th Light is all about craftsmanship.  Doing something we are proud of doing & doing it with enthusiasm, passion, and skill. Dan Cederholm, author of <em>Handcrafted CSS</em> (and the creator of <a href="http://dribbble.com">dribbble</a>), is obviously a proponent of this same mindset, making this book an appropriate addition to my reading.  </p>
<p><em>Handcrafted CSS</em> does something important: it allows us to style things the way we want, while giving us tools to assure that these things degrade gracefully when being viewed with a lesser browser. Responsiveness and media queries are something that I have been learning about slowly through this apprenticeship, and they're obviously a consideration---making things that scale gracefully, no matter if it's on a big, small, or obsolete device. </p>
<p>While I like to think that I'd make something akin to a 404 error message for people with Internet Explorer ("Too bad, maybe you should upgrade to something relevant!"), for some clients, that is obviously not an option. In some occupations, it is common for users to still be booting up a Windows 98 computer and running Internet Explorer 6-8. While we may weep at this very idea, we must also accept it and adapt to it by coming up with new ways to display things the way we want.
<blockquote>"The critical distinction between a craftsman and an expert is what happens after a sufficient level of expertise has been achieved.  The expert will do everything she can to remain wedded to a single context, narrowing the scope of her learning, her practice, and her projects.  The craftsman has the courage and himility to set aside her expertise and pick up an unfamiliar technology or learn a new domain." </blockquote>
