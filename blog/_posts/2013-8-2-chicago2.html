title: "Chicago, Part II"

<p>Last week, my coworker Will and I traveled to Chicago. I so relish these opportunities to go to the big city. It gets me out of my element and comfort zone (plane phobias!), allows me to experience something new and different (food!), and immerses me in the cooperative culture of the office.</p>

<p>My apprenticeship was extended for another two months and my mentor changed to Stephanie, so I went up to get acquainted with her and to be in their office environment a little more.  Adam had his challenges and it was really emotional for all of us--we all got a little teary eyed during Friday's standup. I am so proud of him and eager to get to that point in my apprenticeship as well.</p>
<p>I was able to pair with Stephanie during my trip.  Pair programming has gotten a lot of criticism, claiming that there are "high costs and negative value," but I find it to be an enriching, productive, and engaging experience. It keeps teams tight and encourages the feeling of group ownership of projects and code. During my pairing experience last week, I contributed to solving some big problems and learned a little bit of Objective-C along the way. Both of these things could not have been accomplished without this experience.</p>
