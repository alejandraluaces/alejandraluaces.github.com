<p>Some say that excellent work comes from passion, and some say excellent work comes as a result of great skill. Whatever "house" you belong to, it is a given that good work comes from dedication and preserverence, confidence and determination. </p>
<p>During last week when Nick was in town, we had a discussion about his apprenticeship, specifically the week of his challenges. What he said to me was very profound: both scary, yet comforting. He told me his challenges week was one of the most stressful and trying weeks, that he'd tried his hardest, and was convinced that he was just not good enough. Yet, he was okay with that fact. He knew that his hardest was the best he could do, and with that fact, he was completely content and at peace. He did not stress, he did not fret.</p>
<p>We all want to be an expert in the one thing we put all of our time and effort into. At least, if you are the kind of person I am -- ambitious and curious and hungry to a fault. I think that part of my challenge here at 8th Light is to let go of fear: the fear that I am not good enough, the fear that I will make a fool of myself, the fear that I will fail. I have to bring myself to see that nothing I do here can be considered failure--I am going through a learning and growing process; a dirt road littered with pot holes, weeds, and old tin cans. But the road will lead me to a place where I <em>will</em> be capable of greatness. <strong>Only</strong> if I stop fearing.</p>
<p>Nick also talked to me about one of our company's founders, Micah, who was coincidentally also Nick's mentor when he was an apprentice. Nick told me that Micah expects excellence from everyone -- not perfection or intellegence or anything really mesurable -- but excellence, the marriage of qualities mentioned above: dedication, preserverence, confidence and determination.  Things that you may not be born with, but things that you make the conscious decision to have or not to have. This is what our "boss" values -- people who work hard to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>With this reminder, I am preparing myself to work harder than ever for the final three months of my apprenticeship. I hope to write thorough and insightful blog posts, produce projects that "wow" and are representative of my skill, eccentricity, and newfound skills. I strive to excel in professionalism and kindness, and cultivate fruitful partnerships with my coworkers in preparation for my final challenges. When they come, I strive to be ready!</p>
