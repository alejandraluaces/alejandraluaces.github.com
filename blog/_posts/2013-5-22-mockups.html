<p>These are some mockups I did for my IPM today. I am still working on the school registration project. The shot on the left is the control panel, while the shot on the right is the main registration form.</p>

<p>The registration form page is something we decided not to go with.  My original idea in this project is for the form to be a two-column thing, so I am going to stick with that.  The control panel, however, is an idea Justin came up with, and I really like how it turned out.</p>
<p>Another fun part of this project was making the logo for "Hillsborough Pigeon Preparory School".. ha. Glad to be able to inject a little bit of what I am best at into an otherwise sometimes tedious & slightly intimidating project.</p>
