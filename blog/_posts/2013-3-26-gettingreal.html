title: Getting Real: The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application. 
date: March 26, 2013

<p>Recently, I finished up reading <em>Getting Real</em> by <a href="http://37signals.com/"><em>37signals</em></a>. When I was first assigned this reading, I was told I'd have a lot to say about it.</p>
<p>But I don't. And here's why.</p>
<p>8th Light is the first software company I have ever worked for. Therefore, I am somewhat of a blank slate. Several of my peers have the experience of working in massive companies, companies with management problems, companies that are not run by the principles outlined in this book.</p>
<p>Luckily, because I am such a "blank slate", agile development seems natural to me. As a freelancer, I worked like this without knowing it had a name. It just seems like the easiest way to operate efficiently and get things done. Talk to the customer often, make changes based on evolving needs while sometimes saying "no," and delivering parts of the project once they are ready.</p>
<p><em>Getting Real</em> is a book about more than just software development. It is a book that is accessible, easy to read, and simple to understand. In fact, my boyfriend picked it up and read it when I'd left it at home one day. He is a nurse: not even close to being in the same industry. Yet, the book inspired him.</p>
<p>This book illustrates shedding excess and working with small steps rather than large, seemingly unattainable goals. It touches on creativity, and how it seems to flourish the more restrictions there are in place.  It lets you know that it's okay for things to change during development. Things that not only apply to software, but everything.</p>
