<p>For my Javascript project, I was asked to make a clock that a user would be able to set, start, and stop, with buttons that indicated which "mode" it was in.</p>

<p>I have not written a line of Javascript ever. I was really open to the idea of learning, but was not aware of how hard it would be, and how much patience it would require. Wow. It was like being asked to learn a completely different language on the fly, in another country, completely alone. It's frustrating because not only do you not know how to get around the country, but you have no idea how to articulate what you're doing there, where you're trying to go, and your translation dictionary is completely inefficient, not to mention hard to use in urgent situations. While that seems like an extreme exmample, that's kind of how I felt.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was not completely alone. My mentor, Justin, was happy to help and showed me how to write most of the simple program that operates the clock. From there, I was able to piece some parts together and be able to exercise some more logic. I won't say I have the hang of Javascript--it's quite far from that, really--but I am a little more confident with the logic and navigating/modifying existing code.</p>
