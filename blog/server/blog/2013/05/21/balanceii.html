<p>It is tremendously hard to find balance at this point of my apprenticeship, in almost every aspect of life. I know when I first started, I was having trouble keeping up with housework, keeping up with my relationships, having "me" time, and balancing client work. Things are pretty much the same, but kind of different (wow, so much clarity!).</p><!-- more -->
<p>Estimation is a huge thing at 8th Light. We use Artisan, an internal tool that allows us to calculate how much time we think a project will take in "points". There are two points in a day--so, one point for roughly four hours of work. Being as close to your estimate as possible is the goal--but with my partnership project, I have been off every time.</p>
<p>Another aspect that I find both familiar and intimidating is working on the design of several projects at once. As an ex-freelancer, I am used to this--I'd work on anywhere from 3-5 projects at once. Unfortunately, I have to admit that juggling several tasks at once is not my strong suit--I always end up wanting to play favorites and pay more attention to one or the other, and it leaves me feeling like I need to play catchup on the other less-loved tasks.</p>
<p>So, for now, I know of a couple things I have to do to make my estimates more accurate: I have to use visualization to figure out how much time something will realistically take me, and I have to break bigger parts into several smaller stories. This is the only way I will keep from feeling completely overwhelmed, and will be able to feel more success rather than failure, helping me out in the emotional department as well.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is something I need to work on, and will only get better at with practice.</p>
