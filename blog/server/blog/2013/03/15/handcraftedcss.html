<p>8th Light is all about craftsmanship.  Doing something we are proud of doing & doing it with enthusiasm, passion, and skill. Dan Cederholm, author of <em>Handcrafted CSS</em>, is obviously a huge proponent of this same mindset, making this book an appropriate addition to my reading.  </p><!-- more -->
<p><em>Handcrafted CSS</em> does something important: it allows us to style things the way we want, while giving us tools to assure that these things degrade gracefully when being viewed with a lesser browser. Responsiveness is something that I have been learning about slowly through this apprenticeship, and is definitely a consideration---not only making things that are supported on smaller devices, but also making things that will be supported on older browsers. While I like to think that I'd make something akin to a 404 error message for people with Internet Explorer ("Too bad, maybe you should upgrade to something relevant!"), for some clients, that is obviously not an option. In some occupations, it is common for users to still be booting up a Windows 98 computer and running Internet Explorer 6-8. While we may weep at this very idea, we must also accept it and adapt to it by coming up with new ways to display things the way we want.
<blockquote>"The critical distinction between a craftsman and an expert is what happens after a sufficient level of expertise has been achieved.  The expert will do everything she can to remain wedded to a single context, narrowing the scope of her learning, her practice, and her projects.  The craftsman has the courage and himility to set aside her expertise and pick up an unfamiliar technology or learn a new domain." </blockquote>
