	    <p><p>Today, I will be giving a lightning talk about colors and numbers.  I discussed numbers in design briefly in my post about <a href="http://alejandraluaces.com/decodingdesign.html">Decoding Design: Understanding and Using Symbols in Visual Communication</a>. </p>

      <h4>July 02, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p><em>Decoding Design: Understanding and Using Symbols in Visual Communication</em> turned out to be a really great book. At first, I delayed reading it because the artwork inside seemed outdated, almost textbook-like in nature. Contrary to my first thought, the book is not outdated but covers principles that are firmly rooted in art, mathematics & science and thus, are timeless.</p>

	    <p><p><em>Ordering Disorder</em> by Khoi Vinh is similar to a lot of the other design books I've read during my apprenticeship. Most of its content relates to the grid structure and designing a website.  It also gives a list of steps that can be followed when executing a design.</p>

      <h4>June 23, 2013</h4>
	    <p><p><em>The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</em> is a book whose chapters are written as "tips", giving it a more casual, friendlier feel than many guides to a programming career.  It is meant to be an answer or even rebuttal to <em>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</em>, a book talking about becoming a programmer or advancing in your programming career "by coincidence". The author of the book is also a musician, creating some interesting parallels between that and programming.</p>

It was my first time experiencing flying after what I will affectionately refer to here as the "Baltimore Flying Fiasco of 2011". Of course, as most people do, I learned it was not that bad and really quite great.  After two and a half hours, we were in a completely different and uniquely beautiful place, so it was all well worth it.</p>

I went back and read about semantic HTML and making progress bars with CSS, and laughed aloud at how much better I have gotten, and not just with comptuer-related stuff.</p>

I think it was a lot more relateable for a designer since there were no code samples, and all of what I read I could really relate to and take to heart. I am going to write bullet points outlining the things that really meant the most to me from this book. I am excited to take this new knowledge with me into the future of my career!</p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, like these other things that have stood the test of time, in this industry we will always have some beef between "designers" and "programmers". Even in more modern times where the phrase "web developer" has been coined and niche carved, there still exists some polarity and as such, animosity. So, what's the big deal?</p></p>
