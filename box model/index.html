          <p>The basic premise of the CSS box-object model is that everything on the web is a <strong>rectangle</strong> or "box". Each element on the web has a content area, padding, a border, and a margin, in that order (from inside, out).

            <figure>
              <img src="content.png" />
                <figcaption>
                  <p>The <strong>content area</strong>, though it doesn't look like it, is self-contained in a rectangle. Text and images appear here.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img src="padding.png" />
                <figcaption>
                  <p>The <strong>padding</strong> clears an area around the content. It is affected by the background color and is not transparent.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img src="border.png" />
                <figcaption>
                  <p>The <strong>border</strong> goes around the content area and padding. You can control the color and width of the border, even applying decorative styles.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img src="margin.png" />
              <figcaption>
              <p>The <strong>margin</strong> clears an area outside of the border, and is always transparent.  
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </section>

        <section class='text'>
          <p>In CSS 2.1, if you specified a height and a width for the element, it would only apply to the content area. The margins, padding, and border would be drawn outside of the content area size specified, actually making the element larger.
          <blockquote>
            <h3>width + padding + border = actual visible/rendered width of box</h3>
            <h3>height + padding + border = actual visible/rendered height of box</h3>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In CSS3, a property has been introduced that has changed the box object model.  The <span class="scale"><code>box-sizing</code></span> property allows all of these things--the margin, border, padding, and content area to be drawn inside of the element, rather than outside, giving you more control over size & positioning.
            <pre><code>
              content { 
                -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
                -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
                box-sizing: border-box;
              }
            </code></pre>
            <p>And, of course, you would also add your padding, margins and borders, and find that they rest within the specified height and width.
            <p>With <span class="scale">box-sizing</span>, the default setting is <span class="scale">content-box</span>, which preserves the properties of the former CSS 2.1. <span class="scale">border-box</span> gives the new styling precedence, and <span class="scale">inherit</span>, of course, just inherits whatever's going on in the parent element.
